Authentic Westfjords Horror: Historical Stories for Psychological
Terror (1850-1930)
The most psychologicallyd evastatingt rue storiesf rom Iceland'sd arkest
fjords
Based on extensive research of the Icelandic historical archive Sogur og Sagnir, I've uncovered
authentic Westfjords narratives that provide extraordinary material for your psychological horror film.
These stories, spanning pages 1-5 of the archive, reveal patterns of isolation-induced madness,
supernatural terror, and human depravity that transform your Langibotn, Arnarfjorour setting into
something far more terrifying than fiction.
The Sjounda murders: When winter breaks the human mind
The winter of 1801-1802, known as "Klaki" (The Claw), provides the ultimate psychological horror
foundation. At the isolated farm of Sjounda on Rauoasandur, four adults became trapped in months of
crushing snow and starvation. ( Sogurogsagnir) The historical record describes "hvergi sast hinn minnsti
snefill jar&ar fyrir utigangspening" - not the smallest patch of earth visible for months. ( sogurogsagnir)
( Sogurogsagnir)
In this suffocating isolation, farmhand Bjarni Bjarnason and his neighbor's wife Steinunn Sveinsd6ttir
developed an obsessive sexual relationship that transformed into murderous conspiracy. On April 1,
1802, Bjarni beat Jon Porgrfmsson to death with a gongustaf (walking stick), dragged the body to the
frozen sea, and buried it in snow. When poisoning Bjarni's wife Guorun with rottupu&ur (rat poison)
and mercury compounds failed, the couple strangled her together at the sheep pen - Steinunn holding
her hands while Bjarni choked her to death. ( sogurogsagnir) ( Sogurogsagnir)
The court records detail their execution: Bjarni was tortured with glowing tongs five times, had his right
hand severed while conscious, then beheaded. His body parts were displayed on stakes. ( sogurogsagnir)
(Sogurogsagnir) This story, extensively documented in legal archives, shows how extreme isolation and
starvation can transform ordinary people into monsters within a single winter.
Gunnhildur's century of vengeance
In Sveinseyri, Dyrafjorour, the most persistent haunting in Icelandic history began on August 24, 1793.
Gunnhildur Sumarli&ad6ttir drowned while collecting hay with her brothers, possibly pregnant with
an illegitimate child. ( Sogurogsagnir) ( sogurogsagnir) During her coffin-making, she rose from her deathbed,
forcing her brother to hold an axe over her body. At her funeral, witnesses saw her running around the
churchyard while simultaneously being buried. ( sogurogsagnir)
For 120 years, Gunnhildur's draugur (revenant) terrorized the Westfjords. She appeared to family
descendants before their deaths, killed livestock when angered, and even master sorcerers couldn't
contain her - she only rested on Whitsunday between epistle and gospel readings. The curse was so
powerful that no child was named Gunnhildur in the region for 116 years. (SogurogsagniHr) er haunting
ground, Gunnhildarb6t (Gunnhildur's Cove), remains avoided to this day.
The Nor&ureyrai valanche:N ature's psychologicawl arfare
December 15, 1836, delivered the Westfjords' most documented disaster. At NorOureyri in
SugandafjorOur, housewife Gu&r(m J6nsd6ttir had begged her husband Pall to leave, tormented by
premonitions of avalanche. ( Sogurogsagn(ir S) ogurogsagniHr)e mockingly promised to "rescue her on
KerlingarskeriO" (Woman's Skerry) if disaster struck - dark humor that became prophecy. (Sogurogsagnir)
The avalanche struck at night with such force it carried debris 600 meters across the fjord,
damaging buildings on the opposite shore. ( SogurogsagniSr)i x died instantly: both farmers, one wife, a
servant woman, and two children. A four-year-old boy survived in the cowshed, possibly saved by
falling into the cow's stall. The psychological aftermath destroyed the survivors - one child became
permanently disabled, another woman deaf. The settlement was plagued by 11mannskceaa
snj6skri8a 11 (man-destroying avalanches) repeatedly until final abandonment. ( Sogurogsagnir)
( Sogurogsagnir)
Mosdalur: The incest valley
The most disturbing narrative emerges from Mosdalur, bnundarfjorOur, winter 1735-1736. Sigmundur
Guamundsson committed incest with his daughter Halld6ra in their isolated valley farm. She gave
birth to her father's child on the night before the 16th Sunday after Trinity, autumn 1736. Both
confessed willingly to their bl68sk6mm (blood shame) and were held in prison for twenty months
through two winters before execution at l=>ingvelli-r Sigmundur beheaded, Halld6ra drowned in the
drekkingarhyl (drowning pool) as one of the last women executed this way in Iceland. (sogurogsagnir)
The valley itself was notorious for driving inhabitants to madness through isolation. Multiple accounts
describe psychological breakdowns, including Dagur Siguraarson, who refused all food and wrapped
himself in ropes to ward off hunger, hiding in a cave called Dagshola (Dag's Hole) between stones.
( Sogurogsagnir)
The Latin Ghost of Arnarfjoraur
Your target fjord, ArnarfjorOur, has its own unique horror. Around 1800, a French ship wrecked in the
fjord with all hands lost. The crew became revenants, but while local priests laid most to rest, one
ghost - the Latinudraugur (Latin Ghost) - only understood Latin and couldn't be banished.
( Sogurogsagn+i2r)
This foreign specter rode on rooftops making every timber creak. When confronted, witnesses
described the ghost's body sliding down from the roof while its head remained at the same height,
peering over the house edge with its neck stretching impossibly. Only a learned priest fluent in Latin
could finally communicate with and banish it (Sogurogsagnir) ( sogurogsagnir) - a perfect metaphor for
linguistic isolation adding to psychological terror.
RassbeltingurT: he belt ghost's generationalc urse
The ghost Rassbeltingur (Belt-Arse), named for the belt around its waist, represents supernatural
revenge at its most calculated. When young Einar Snaebjarnarson was rejected by Gu0run in the 1780s,
he either personally raised the corpse of Arni bl6ti through sorcery or had the infamous sorcerer J6n
sk61di o it. ( Sogurogsagnir) ( sogurogsagnir)
The ghost, appearing in a m6grar ulpa (grey cloak) and slapahatt (slouch hat), systematically
destroyed Gu0run's new family in Hringsdal. It broke her husband Sturla's neck in the hayfield, killed
the cattle-hand, drove both daughters immediately insane, and terrorized all livestock. Yet it never
harmed Gu0run herself - a twisted mercy. ( sogurogsagnir) The ghost became an aettarfylgja (familyfollowing
spirit), haunting descendants for generations, even disrupting church services when
Gu0run's son became a priest.
SupernaturalA rnarfjor&ur:P erfect for your Langibotns etting
Multiple stories from Arnarfjor0ur provide location-specific horror elements. (Sogurogsagnir)
Hokinsdalur valley housed 61afur loainn (the Hairy), described as "fjolkunnugur og
6jafnaaarmaaur hinn mesti" (most skilled in sorcery and most quarrelsome). He engaged in sorcery
battles with neighbors, each attempting to destroy the other's livestock through galdrar (spells).
(sogurogsagnir) The valley contains Djoflabas (Devil's Booth), where drowned men's spirits cause
perpetual disturbances. ( sogurogsagnir) ( Sogurogsagnir)
Jon dettir, a priest in Hokinsdalur (1736-1755), was stripped of his position for becoming "ofurolvi i
miari messu" (extremely drunk mid-mass), representing religious authority's breakdown in isolation.
(sogurogsagnir) During the reykjarold (sulfur age) witch persecutions, accused sorcerers hid in sea
caves near Langanesta. ( sogurogsagnir +3)
Drangar: Supernatural strength and doomed love
In Dyrafjor0ur, the abandoned farm Drangar (cursed since 1937) was home to Guamundur Justsson
(1841-1888), "the strongest man on all the Westfjords." His supernatural strength - lifting 500-pound
weights with tongs, carrying 200 pounds of grain 50km over mountains without rest - suggests
otherworldly forces. He once stacked three American sailors on top of each other and sat on them so
none could move. (sogurogsagnir)
The farm's tragic love story involves Kristin J6nsd6ttir and poet Magnus Hjaltason. Their doomed
romance led to psychological torment, with Magnus descending into madness and imprisonment.
( sogurogsagnir) The location features Hagratur (High Weeping), a massive stone named after a child's
cries when taken by an eagle. GuOmundur's famous phrase "Og t>6 blakta blessua strain" (And yet
the blessed straw flutters) became a local saying after his irritated response to being woken.
( sogurogsagnir) ( Sogurogsagnir)
Gilsbrekka: Starvation's slow horror
This SugandafjorOur farm, active until 1912, represents psychological breakdown through slow
starvation. (Sogurogsagnir) In 1897-1898, farmer Jarea Jon Hafli8ason watched his sheep die one by
one, his cow barely surviving "mea piningi" (in agony), horses enduring "mea kvolum" (in torment).
( Sogurogsagnir) His wife Elisabet, described as "gafua vel og myndarleg en mea kaupstaaarlifshug II
(intelligent and refined but with town-living aspirations), embodied the psychological clash between
refined sensibilities and brutal survival reality. ( Sogurogsagnir)
Multiple drowning incidents, including mass drownings taking workers from neighboring farms, created
an atmosphere of constant death. The farm's multi-generational accounts show families torn apart,
children forcibly removed by authorities, and couples separated by circumstances beyond their
control.
Cultural authenticity for production
Essential Icelandic concepts that must remain untranslated:
• Klaki - The Claw (the killing winter of 1801-1802)
• Draugagangur - ghost-walking phenomenon
• Reimleikur - supernatural troubles/hauntings
• Sendingar - magical attacks sent by sorcerers
• Fjolkyngi - sorcery/dark knowledge
• A:ttarfylgja - hereditary haunting spirit
• Alagablettur - cursed spots where entities dwell
• Utburaur - exposed infant (infanticide reference)
• l>urrabuaarf61k - landless people in turf huts
• Verstoavar - seasonal fishing stations
Atmospheric elements for cinematography: The stories provide specific sensory details: meaingaveaur
(piercing storms), snj6t>yngsli (crushing snow loads), fannalog (snow drifts blocking all
movement). ( sogurogsagn(i rS) ogurogsagnRir)iv ers "vomiting up" corpses in spring thaw. ( Sogurogsagnir)
The sound of "Hagratur" (high weeping) echoing from cliffs. Church bells disrupted by supernatural
presences. The crack of breaking necks described as "halsbrotinn" (neck-broken).
Recommendationsfo r your Langibotns cript
The Sjounda murders provide the perfect psychological foundation - showing how a single winter can
transform sexual tension into calculated murder. ( sogurogsagnLira) yer this with Gunnhildur's haunting
for supernatural persistence across generations. The Latin Ghost adds the terror of incomprehensible
foreign elements in familiar landscapes.
For Arnarfjorour specificity, incorporate Hokinsdalur's sorcery battles and the Djoflabas devil's
booth location. The concept of aettarfylgja (family-following spirits) creates hereditary horror perfect
for multi-generational narratives. The Noraureyri avalanche pattern - premonitions ignored, dark
humor becoming prophecy - provides natural disaster as psychological weapon. ( Sogurogsagnir)
Most crucially, these aren't folklore but documented historical events with court records, death
certificates, and eyewitness accounts. This authenticity transforms your film from horror fiction into
something far more disturbing - a window into how isolation, starvation, and cultural beliefs created
real psychological breakdowns that destroyed entire communities in Iceland's most remote fjords.

essential for truly effective psychological horror.
