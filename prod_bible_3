FOUNDATIONAL PRODUCTION PHILOSOPHY
The Three-Layer Reality Principle (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT)
Every single frame must support three simultaneous interpretations. This is not ambiguity through vagueness but precision through multiplicity:
Layer 1: PHYSICAL REALITY

Hákarl neurotoxins (trimethylamine oxide) causing hallucinations
Starvation ketosis producing altered consciousness
Hypothermia confusion (body temperature below 35°C)
Ergot contamination from damp stored grain
Carbon monoxide poisoning from poor ventilation
Seal meat parasites affecting neurological function

Layer 2: PSYCHOLOGICAL REALITY

Dissociative fugue state from sustained trauma
Folie à famille (shared psychotic disorder)
Guilt manifestation as physical transformation
Collective hysteria from isolation (cabin fever)
Morgundrengur - specific Icelandic morning confusion
Paternal breakdown from provider role failure

Layer 3: SUPERNATURAL REALITY

Tilberi invocation succeeding but wrong
Forystufé (leader sheep) claiming the family as flock
Huldufolk intervention (hidden people justice)
Ancient land spirits responding to desperation
Punishment for unconscious cannibalism
Transformation as escape from human suffering

Testing Principle: Read each shot three ways. All must work.
The Action Blindspot Solution (Technical Reality)
AI image generation cannot convincingly create:

Complex physical interactions between multiple subjects
Transformation moments or morphing effects
Precise emotional expressions during movement
Consistent facial features across extreme angles
Multiple subjects with distinct actions simultaneously
Violence or impact moments

Our Solution Framework:
INSTEAD OFWE SHOWThe strike happeningLamp swinging after impactTransformation occurringHuman face, then sheep faceComplex interactionBefore and after positionsEmotional breakdownPhysical manifestation (shaking hands)Death momentDiscovery of bodies/absenceRitual succeedingEnvironmental response
Scale as Narrative Architecture
The camera movement tells its own story of abandonment:
DistanceMeaningEmotion5000 feet (Cosmic)Divine indifferenceAwe/Terror100 feet (Geographic)Social isolationLoneliness12 feet (Domestic)Family compressionClaustrophobia3 feet (Personal)Internal experienceIntimacy1 inch (Microscopic)Reality breakdownDisorientation5000 feet (Return)Final abandonmentCosmic horror
The Doubling/Mirror Principle (NEW EMPHASIS)
Everything exists in pairs that don't quite match:

5 family members / 5 sheep (but counting 6)
2 women perform rituals / 2 succeed differently
2 oars → 1 breaks (incomplete pairs)
Every V-notch has a twin
Shadows that don't match their sources
Reflections that show wrong images
