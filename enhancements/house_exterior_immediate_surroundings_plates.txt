MASTER EXTERIOR PLATE
Authentic 1888 Hornstrandir Poor Family Housing

HOUSE-EXTERIOR-MASTER: Small impoverished turf house 16×20ft exterior dimensions (interior 12×16ft due to 3ft thick turf walls), low profile building only 8ft height at peak indicating poverty-level construction, built directly into hillside for wind protection and insulation, green grass growing on turf roof creating living architecture blended with landscape, single stone chimney 6ft height with irregular volcanic rock construction, northeast-facing wooden door (5ft tall) made from driftwood planks with iron hinges showing rust, small south window (2×2ft) with thick handblown glass set in driftwood frame, turf walls showing exposed straw and moss construction layers, foundation built on black volcanic rock with stones selected for wind resistance, immediate surroundings: ram pen 30ft east (empty stone walls), water source 50ft south (natural spring), outdoor work area 20ft west (stone fire circle, tool storage), wind shelter created by hillside positioning, single worn path connecting door to ram pen to water source, evidence of extreme poverty through small scale and minimal construction, building appearing to breathe subtly (12 breaths per minute) creating living architecture effect, smoke from chimney pulsing rhythmically matching house respiratory cycle.

IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS: Black volcanic landscape within 200ft radius, ram pen stone walls 4ft height, natural spring surrounded by worn stones, outdoor fire circle with ash accumulation, scattered traditional tools (ropes, nets, iron implements), worn foot paths creating navigation system, wind-sculpted snow formations, minimal vegetation except roof grass, complete isolation with no other structures visible, natural acoustic properties creating wind music through stone formations.

POVERTY INDICATORS: Small scale construction, minimal height, irregular stone selection, worn materials, limited window size, simple door construction, basic chimney, evidence of hand-construction rather than professional building.

PROGRESSIVE EXTERIOR TRANSFORMATION PLATES

**PROLOGUE PERIOD: DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE**

EXTERIOR 1: Traditional Dwelling (Shots 1-15)
HOUSE-TRADITIONAL: [Master base] appearing purely architectural - turf construction appearing entirely constructed rather than geological, grass roof perfectly maintained creating natural camouflage with landscape, chimney smoke rising straight indicating calm weather and proper draft, wooden door and window appearing functional and maintained, stone foundation stable and architectural, house breathing imperceptible from exterior (appearing static), immediate surroundings organized for traditional farming and fishing activity, ram pen showing signs of recent livestock presence, outdoor work areas arranged for community cooperation, poverty evident but dignified through traditional construction methods.

**Camera Considerations:** Traditional architecture cinematography, domestic building documentation, poverty but dignity through traditional craftsmanship.

EXTERIOR 2: Organic Awakening (Shots 16-25)
HOUSE-AWAKENING: [Traditional base] with subtle geological emergence - turf walls beginning to show natural stone stratification beneath organic covering, roof grass growing more vibrantly suggesting supernatural nourishment, chimney smoke pulsing more obviously with house breathing rhythm, wooden elements appearing to flex slightly with structural breathing, foundation stones beginning to show natural geometric arrangement rather than constructed positioning, house breathing becoming visible as subtle wall expansion (1-inch movement), immediate surroundings beginning to show mathematical organization with paths following geometric patterns, ram pen stones aligning into landvættir symbols, outdoor areas arranging themselves for supernatural rather than practical function.

**Camera Considerations:** Subtle organic movement cinematography, breathing architecture documentation, supernatural enhancement of traditional construction.

**MAIN STORY WINTER: GEOLOGICAL EMERGENCE**

EXTERIOR 3: Stone Foundation (Shots 26-45)
HOUSE-GEOLOGICAL: [Awakening base] with obvious stone nature - turf walls revealing extensive stone structure beneath organic covering, foundation stones clearly showing natural basalt formation rather than construction, roof grass struggling as organic covering fighting geological emergence beneath, chimney smoke creating geometric patterns indicating internal geological activity, wooden elements contrasting sharply with increasing stone dominance, house breathing obvious as wall movement (2-inch expansion) creating architectural respiratory cycle, immediate surroundings showing stone formations emerging from soil, ram pen revealing ancient stone circle rather than constructed walls, paths wearing into stone beneath earth surface indicating permanent geological navigation system.

**Camera Considerations:** Stone emergence cinematography, geological formation documentation, organic-to-mineral transition emphasis.

EXTERIOR 4: Cliff Formation (Shots 46-60)
HOUSE-CLIFF: [Geological base] with vertical development beginning - walls showing clear vertical stone striations suggesting cliff formation, building height appearing taller (12ft sensation) without measurement change, stone foundation extending deeper into earth as cliff roots develop, turf covering struggling to contain expanding stone structure beneath, chimney elongating as cliff formation extends upward, wooden elements appearing temporary against permanent stone emergence, house breathing creating geological sounds (stone grinding) rather than organic sounds, immediate surroundings revealing cliff formation geography with natural stone outcroppings emerging, ram pen transformed into natural stone amphitheater, paths becoming cliff ledges worn into stone formation.

**Camera Considerations:** Cliff formation cinematography with increasing vertical emphasis, geological transformation documentation, stone architecture emergence over organic construction.

**TRANSFORMATION PERIOD: OBSIDIAN MONUMENT**

EXTERIOR 5: Crystallization Active (Shots 61-75)
HOUSE-CRYSTALLIZING: [Cliff base] with obsidian formation accelerating - walls pure black stone with obsidian veining spreading through basalt structure, building appearing to grow vertically (20ft sensation) through cliff formation, crystallization creating geometric patterns and sharp edges in stone surface, turf covering completely eliminated revealing pure geological formation, chimney becoming stone column integrated with cliff architecture, wooden elements crystallizing into mineral forms, house breathing creating crystalline sounds (glass formation) at 528Hz frequency, immediate surroundings transformed into natural cliff environment with obsidian outcroppings, former ram pen becoming natural stone circle with geometric precision, paths crystallized into cliff ledges with perfect geometric formation.

**Camera Considerations:** Crystallization process cinematography, obsidian formation lighting effects, geological perfection documentation.

EXTERIOR 6: Monument Complete (Shots 76-85)
HOUSE-MONUMENT: [Crystallizing base] with obsidian monument completion - 40ft black obsidian obelisk rising from cliff formation, perfect geometric architecture with vertical cleft through center, transparent volcanic glass walls revealing family conscious inside eternal imprisonment, crystalline perfection creating supernatural monument architecture, obsidian surface reflecting all light sources creating mirror-like illumination, monument breathing stopped (geological completion), immediate surroundings pure cliff environment with geometric stone formations, former domestic areas transformed into natural cliff geography, paths becoming cliff ledges leading to monument base, acoustic properties perfect obsidian resonance creating eternal monument sound signature.

**Camera Considerations:** Monument cinematography with obsidian perfection, transparent volcanic glass for family visibility, eternal architecture documentation.
