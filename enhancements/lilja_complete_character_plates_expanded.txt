**Acting Direction:** Child prophetic authority delivering transformation predictions through lullaby evolution, voice carrying prophetic weight despite youth, movements ceremonial during prophetic song delivery.

PLATE 7: Transformation Acceptance (Shots 41-55)
LILJA-ACCEPTING: [Evolving base] with transformation enthusiasm - face bright with transformation excitement rather than fear, mouth practicing sheep vocalizations with child enthusiasm, blue eyes eager with transformation anticipation, hair cut short revealing skull changes, grey dress loose on changing body proportions, brown stockings replaced with wool wrapping, doll clutched through transformation as comfort anchor, posture showing adaptation excitement, voice mixing sheep sounds with child emotional expression, breathing shifting from 23/min child to 20/min sheep with enthusiasm, wool production beginning from child follicles with fascination rather than shame.

**Acting Direction:** Child excitement about family transformation rather than fear, voice enthusiastically adapting to sheep-child communication, movements testing transformation capabilities with child curiosity.

PLATE 8: Final Child Consciousness (Shots 56-65)
LILJA-FINAL: [Accepting base] before consciousness simplification - face maintaining child emotional expression despite anatomical changes, mouth adapted for sheep vocalization but retaining child emotional range, blue eyes showing child consciousness preparing for simplification, hair completely wool-textured, grey dress becoming natural lamb covering, doll integrated somehow with lamb anatomy, posture transitional between child uprightness and lamb configuration, voice child consciousness through sheep anatomy, breathing 20/min sheep rhythm with child awareness, final child thoughts visible through changing anatomy.

**Acting Direction:** Child consciousness maintaining emotional complexity before simplification into animal awareness, voice child thoughts through changing anatomy, movements child behavior through transforming body.

PLATE 9: Simple Lamb (Shots 65-85)

CONSCIOUSNESS RETENTION DIFFERENCE

**Unlike Adults:** Lilja does NOT retain human consciousness after transformation
**Child Simplification:** Transforms into simple lamb awareness
**No Human Complexity:** Pure animal consciousness without intellectual retention
**Emotional Simplification:** Basic lamb emotional responses only
**Instinctive Behavior:** Natural herd following without human behavioral complexity

This reflects authentic child psychology where transformation represents **return to simpler consciousness** rather than **tragic loss of complexity** - children accepting animal awareness as **natural progression** rather than **violation** of human identity.
