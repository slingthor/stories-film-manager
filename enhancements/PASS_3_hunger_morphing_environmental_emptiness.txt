PASS 3: HUNGER MORPHING TO ENVIRONMENTAL EMPTINESS
Starvation Becoming Landscape Feature Through Emotional Physics

SHOT HEADER:
Progressive State: Hunger 21 days accumulated | Environmental emptiness spreading | Starvation as geography | 
Camera following hunger as it becomes landscape | Emotional contamination environmental | Physical need creating void-space

ENHANCED VERSION: THE APPETITE LANDSCAPE

SUBJECT:
Camera following family's accumulated hunger as it morphs from internal bodily sensation into external environmental emptiness—starvation expanding beyond individual bodies to become landscape feature where emotional need creates physical void-space throughout Westfjords environment. Hunger begins as visible entity within family bodies: empty stomach spaces glowing with absence-light, nutritional void creating internal darkness that expands outward through skin boundaries into domestic space. Camera follows hunger expansion as it consumes environmental abundance: empty shelves morphing into empty landscape, missing food becoming missing fauna, internal starvation expanding to become external ecological emptiness where British trawling appears as hunger-externalization rather than separate industrial activity.

ACTION:
Hunger morphs from internal bodily sensation to external geographical emptiness through emotional physics where psychological need creates environmental void-space—family starvation expanding beyond body boundaries to consume landscape abundance through appetite-physics strong enough to empty environment. Camera follows hunger as moving entity: starvation flowing from family bodies into domestic space emptying shelves, then into landscape eliminating wildlife, finally into fjord creating maritime void where hunger becomes trawler extraction through appetite externalization. Hunger expansion reveals starvation as environmental force: emotional need creating geographical emptiness, psychological appetite becoming physical absence throughout landscape, family hunger morphing into Iceland hunger that empties environment through national starvation affecting geological scale.

SCENE:
Scale transition from individual bodily hunger to environmental emptiness showing starvation as landscape feature, family need expanding to become geographical void-space where emotional hunger creates physical absence throughout Westfjords environment.

STYLE:
Camera following hunger expansion using impossible appetite-scale morphing (that's where the camera is), riding starvation as it grows from bodily to environmental to geographical scale. Movement follows hunger physics as emotional need creates environmental emptiness. Focus maintains clarity during scale transition from internal appetite to external void-space.

DIALOGUE:
FAMILY HUNGER (experienced as expanding emptiness): Internal appetite morphing into environmental absence without language.

SOUNDS:
Hunger expansion producing acoustic scaling as appetite grows from bodily 100Hz internal sounds to environmental 60Hz emptiness resonance to geographical 40Hz void-space hum matching trawler frequency, starvation morphing into industrial extraction through emotional physics.

TECHNICAL (NEGATIVE PROMPT):
no normal hunger response, no realistic starvation effects, no separate environmental emptiness, no industrial extraction independence, no normal emotional boundaries

CREATIVE NOTES:
Serves story by connecting family starvation to environmental emptiness through emotional physics, showing British trawler extraction as hunger externalization rather than separate industrial activity, individual appetite morphing into national hunger creating geographical void-space, establishing starvation as environmental force that empties landscape through psychological need affecting geological scale, preparation for understanding family transformation as part of larger environmental emptiness where traditional abundance disappears through appetite-physics operating at landscape level.
