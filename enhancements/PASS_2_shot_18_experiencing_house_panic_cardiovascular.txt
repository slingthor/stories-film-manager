PASS 2: SHOT 18 - EXPERIENCING HOUSE PANIC CARDIOVASCULAR
Camera Becoming Bergrisi's Heartbeat During Abandonment Fear

SHOT HEADER:
Progressive State: House heartbeat 60-80bpm panic acceleration | Door handle flesh-soft | Bergrisi protecting family | 
Camera becoming giant's cardiovascular system | Abandonment panic physiological | Organic architecture revealed

ENHANCED VERSION: THE GIANT'S CARDIAC TERROR

SUBJECT:
Camera becoming Bergrisi's cardiovascular system during abandonment panic—experiencing house heartbeat acceleration from calm 60bpm to terror 80bpm as giant consciousness realizes family exposure to winter dangers, cardiac perspective revealing domestic space as organ-interior where family lives inside giant's chest cavity. Camera experiences heartbeat as spatial movement: cardiac rhythm creating expansion/contraction of room dimensions, heartbeat affecting architectural space through cardiovascular influence on building structure. Door handle flesh-softening experienced as vascular response: giant's circulation affecting building materials, organic architecture revealing biological nature through cardiovascular panic, wood becoming flesh as Bergrisi's anatomy emerges through emotional distress.

ACTION:
Camera rides heartbeat acceleration as Bergrisi consciousness panics about family abandonment—cardiovascular rhythm creating spatial pulsing where room expands during systole (heart contraction), contracts during diastole (heart relaxation), family living space affected by giant's cardiac distress. Heartbeat panic spreads through house structure: walls perspiring at 37°C as giant sweats fear, floor warming beneath family feet as circulation increases, organic architecture revealing biological nature through cardiovascular emergency response. Camera experiences door resistance as circulatory response: flesh-soft handle emerging through vascular influence on building materials, Bergrisi's circulation system affecting domestic infrastructure to prevent family exposure to killing environment.

SCENE:
Interior house structure during cardiovascular panic where giant consciousness experiences terror about family abandonment, domestic space revealed as organ-interior through cardiac emergency response, building materials showing biological nature through circulation system activation.

STYLE:
Camera experiencing giant's cardiovascular system using impossible cardiac perspective (that's where the camera is), movement determined by heartbeat rhythm affecting architectural space. Focus reveals organic architecture through cardiovascular response, building materials showing biological nature through circulation emergency. Movement follows cardiac expansion/contraction affecting room dimensions during panic response.

DIALOGUE:
BERGRISI CONSCIOUSNESS (through heartbeat rhythm): Cardiac distress creating communication through cardiovascular emergency rather than language.

SOUNDS:
Heartbeat acceleration from 60 to 80bpm creating building panic rhythm audible through walls, floor, ceiling. Cardiovascular distress producing circulation sounds as giant's blood pressure increases. Door handle flesh-softening creating organic material sounds as wood becomes vascular tissue through circulation influence.

TECHNICAL (NEGATIVE PROMPT):
no mechanical heartbeat, no artificial building response, no normal door handle behavior, no static architectural materials, no unconscious building function

CREATIVE NOTES:
Serves story by revealing house as living organism through cardiovascular emergency response, showing Bergrisi consciousness as protective family member rather than neutral shelter, giant's cardiac terror establishing emotional relationship between building and inhabitants, organic architecture emerging through circulation panic preparing for later revelation that family has always lived inside dying landvættir body serving as protective shelter.
