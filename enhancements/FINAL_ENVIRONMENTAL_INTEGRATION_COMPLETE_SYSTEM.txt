ENVIRONMENTAL STORYTELLING THEMES

**PROLOGUE ENVIRONMENTAL STORY:**
All environments cooperating to create false abundance - house providing perfect shelter, sea enabling easy hunting, landscape offering supernatural beauty, creating predatory seduction through environmental conspiracy to appear helpful.

**WINTER ENVIRONMENTAL STORY:**  
All environments revealing true nature - house as dying giant body, sea as extraction victim, landscape as supernatural battleground, family trapped within geological transformation beyond their control.

**TRANSFORMATION ENVIRONMENTAL STORY:**
All environments crystallizing into eternal witness - house becoming monument, sea becoming mirror, landscape becoming memorial, family preserved as eternal testimony within geological formation.

**MONUMENT ENVIRONMENTAL STORY:**
All environments serving eternal memorial function - obsidian monument reflecting in eternal sea mirror, integrated with permanent landscape, providing eternal witness space for family sacrifice testimony.
