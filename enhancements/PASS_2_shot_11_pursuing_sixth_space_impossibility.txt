PASS 2: SHOT 11 - PURSUING THE SIXTH SPACE IMPOSSIBILITY
Camera Chasing Imperial Addition Through Impossible Geography

SHOT HEADER:
Progressive State: Storage spaces 20 physical, 24 counted | Sixth space manifesting | Imperial mathematics active | 
Camera pursuing impossible space | Mathematical contamination spreading | Administrative ghost creating room

ENHANCED VERSION: HUNTING THE IMPERIAL ADDITION

SUBJECT:
Camera pursuing the mathematical impossibility of additional storage spaces that appear during Guðrún's counting—chasing imperial mathematics as it creates extra room where none should exist physically. Twenty storage spaces exist architecturally but twenty-four appear during enumeration, camera hunting the four additional spaces created by colonial counting contamination. Imperial mathematics generates phantom storage areas through administrative multiplication—Danish bureaucratic counting creating spatial additions that accommodate colonial resource extraction requirements, impossible geography serving imperial mathematical needs. Camera tracks mathematical contamination as it spreads through domestic space: counting confusion creating additional spatial dimensions, imperial arithmetic forcing architecture to accommodate impossible room-count through supernatural spatial expansion.

ACTION:
Camera hunts additional spaces by following Guðrún's counting confusion—racing between physical spaces (1-20) then pursuing mathematical additions (21-24) that exist in imperial counting dimension but not architectural reality. Mathematical contamination creates temporary spatial expansion: room stretching to accommodate impossible count, walls shifting to create additional storage areas during colonial enumeration, imperial mathematics forcing architecture to serve administrative needs. Camera experiences impossible geography where space accommodates mathematical impossibility—twenty physical spaces becoming twenty-four during Danish counting protocol, colonial arithmetic creating architectural additions through administrative spatial manipulation. Pursuit reveals imperial mathematics as spatial contamination: Danish counting requiring more room than Iceland provides, administrative enumeration expanding domestic space to serve colonial inventory requirements.

SCENE:
Storage area during mathematical contamination where imperial counting creates impossible spatial expansion, traditional architecture forced to accommodate colonial administrative requirements through supernatural room multiplication, Danish mathematics contaminating domestic geography.

STYLE:
Camera hunting impossible spaces using mathematical pursuit movement (that's where the camera is), chasing imperial additions through architectural impossibility. Movement follows counting confusion creating spatial pursuit through impossible geography. Focus reveals mathematical contamination affecting architectural reality, imperial arithmetic creating spatial additions through administrative environmental manipulation.

DIALOGUE:
GUÐRÚN (counting, increasingly confused): "Tuttugu... tuttugu og einn... hvar er tuttugu og einn?" (Twenty... twenty-one... where is twenty-one?)

SOUNDS:
Imperial mathematics creating 40Hz administrative frequency as additional spaces manifest through colonial counting contamination. Spatial expansion producing 300Hz architectural adjustment sounds as room accommodates impossible count. Mathematical contamination generating 200Hz imperial enumeration rhythm as Danish counting creates geographical additions.

TECHNICAL (NEGATIVE PROMPT):
no normal room counting, no architectural stability, no static space dimensions, no natural storage area behavior, no normal mathematical relationships

CREATIVE NOTES:
Serves story by making audience experience mathematical impossibility through spatial pursuit, showing imperial mathematics as architectural contamination creating impossible geography, Danish counting forcing domestic space to accommodate administrative requirements, preparing for complete spatial breakdown where house contains impossible measurements serving colonial categorization through environmental mathematical contamination affecting architectural reality.
