Current Issue: Effective violence but needs viral door impossibility and reality breakdown
Viral AI Integration: Architectural material transmutation + Selective freeze + Atmospheric invasion

SHOT 41-42: THE FLESH DOOR VIOLATION
Progressive State: House consciousness 80% resistant | Door anatomy revealed | Violence forcing entry | 
Camera experiencing architectural trauma | Bergrisi biological resistance | Entry requiring anatomical violation

SUBJECT:
Magnus forcing entry through door displaying biological resistance—wooden door surface transmuting to flesh-like material creating anatomical barrier requiring physical violation for entry, architectural material consciousness resisting patriarchal violence through biological door transformation impossible with normal wood physics. Selective freeze during forced entry: Magnus moving normal speed while family freezes in defensive positions, violence temporal manipulation creating time-flow distortion enabling violence preparation while family exists in temporal paralysis. Atmospheric invasion visible: minus-30°C air entering through forced door creating conscious predator entity, cold air displaying hunting behavior pursuing family warmth through atmospheric consciousness invasion via architectural violation enabling environmental assault on family protection.

ACTION:
Door material transmutation resistance: wooden surface becoming flesh-like barrier requiring anatomical violation for entry, architectural consciousness protecting family through biological door transformation creating physical resistance against patriarchal violence via door anatomy manifestation. Forced entry anatomical violation: Magnus requiring physical force against flesh-door resistance, architectural biological protection forcing violence against building anatomy to achieve family access through door consciousness transformation serving family protection function. Selective freeze violence preparation: family experiencing temporal paralysis during violence approach, patriarchal assault creating time-flow manipulation enabling violence preparation while family exists in frozen defensive positions through temporal violence coordination impossible with normal physics.

SCENE:
House entrance during architectural consciousness resistance where biological door protection requires anatomical violation for patriarchal entry, building material transmutation serving family protection through flesh-door barrier creation.
