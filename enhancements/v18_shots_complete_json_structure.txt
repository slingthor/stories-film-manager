Ocean in background rises 3 feet, holds for 2 seconds, drops 3 feet. No wind causing this movement. Purple-black berries on distant hills appear wet, juice dripping down leaves. Cliffs to the right glow golden in horizontal morning sunlight. At pole's base, grass shows three distinct stains in soil - red circle, purple circle, gold circle, each 3 feet wide. Camera continues descent, now 50 feet above pole. Shadow moves independently of sun position, rotating slowly clockwise.",

Behind her, three whale spouts rise from ocean - water shoots up 20 feet. She continues singing, mouth moving: 'kaldri vetrarnóttu á.' Frost forms on grass around her feet, spreading outward in circle, white crystals despite summer. Her right hand reaches out, touches pole.

Boats float immediately. Men climb over sides, water dripping from boots. Take positions at oars - two men per side. Begin rowing. All twelve men pull oars simultaneously. Each stroke moves boats 6 feet forward. Water parts around boat bows, red color intensifying where disturbed.

Raises 7-foot spear above shoulder. Two other men in other boats also stand, spears raised. Whale continues moving forward at 2 knots. Magnús throws spear. It flies in arc, iron point enters flesh 2 feet deep behind whale's left pectoral fin. Immediately blood flows from wound - bright red, thick. Second spear enters whale's back near dorsal fin. Third spear hits lower back. All three spears remain embedded, shafts sticking out at angles. Blood flows from all three wounds, running down grey skin into water.
