ADVANCED SHOT SYSTEM STRUCTURE TEMPLATE
Modular System for Multiple Prompts, Variants, and Temporal Tracking

OVERVIEW:
Each shot exists as individual file containing multiple prompt variants, character plate options, environmental configurations, and systematic tracking across all temporal progressions. System enables granular control through percentage sliders for all tracked elements.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Each shot becomes individual JSON file with this structure
- Percentage sliders control all temporal tracking systems
- Multiple prompt variants allow testing different approaches
- Character plates link to external system files
- Video references track generation attempts and results
- System tags enable filtering and progression control
- Modular structure allows independent shot development while maintaining overall coherence

This structure provides unprecedented granular control over every element while maintaining systematic organization and narrative coherence across the complete film project.
