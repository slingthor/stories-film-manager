PASS 2: SHOT 1B - FOLLOWING DIVINE SACRIFICE CONSCIOUSNESS
Riding Hafstrambur's Willing Death-Energy Through Predatory Seduction

SHOT HEADER:
Progressive State: Divine sacrifice 100% willing | Death-consciousness traveling | Spear blessing energy | 
Camera riding whale's acceptance | Sacred cooperation flowing | Landvættir wisdom transferring

ENHANCED VERSION: CONSCIOUSNESS AS CAMERA MOVEMENT

SUBJECT:
Camera riding Hafstrambur's consciousness as it flows from dying whale brain toward human community, experiencing divine sacrifice decision as moving perspective—whale's willingness to die for human survival becoming camera movement that travels from maritime death-site to terrestrial benefit-site. Consciousness flow reveals whale's complete knowledge: family starvation 400km away, winter survival requiring blubber sacrifice, traditional hunting protocols enabling community cooperation through divine death. Camera becomes whale's final thought-process traveling through water, air, landscape toward Westfjords settlements where death-gift will enable winter survival. Divine consciousness shows temporal perspective: seeing hunt as latest in centuries of willing sacrifice, whale species consciously enabling human survival through systematic guardian death-gift across generations.

ACTION:
Camera begins inside whale's brain during spear approach, experiencing divine decision-making as spatial movement—acceptance flowing through neural pathways creates forward motion toward spear-impact sites, consciousness choosing death-locations for optimal human benefit. Divine thought-process becomes camera trajectory: whale calculating spear angles for best meat yield, blood flow patterns for proper preservation, death timing for community processing advantage. Consciousness travels from brain through body toward impact sites, experiencing dying process as journey rather than termination—whale's awareness flowing through cardiovascular system creating blood-spiral patterns that will guide family mathematics. Final consciousness transfer: camera rides whale's death-energy as it flows through blood into water, across fjord surface, through atmospheric circulation toward Westfjords settlements where sacrifice enables survival.

SCENE:
Perspective shifts from maritime sacrifice-site to terrestrial benefit-site following consciousness flow, whale's dying awareness traveling through environmental circulation toward human community. Divine death-energy serving as bridge between oceanic abundance and domestic survival, consciousness transfer connecting sacrifice to benefit across impossible distance.

STYLE:
Camera movement determined by whale consciousness flow rather than mechanical tracking (that's where the camera is), organic movement following divine thought-processes and death-energy circulation. Focus follows consciousness pathway from brain to body to water to atmosphere to land. Lighting from whale's dying awareness creating bioluminescent trail through environmental circulation.

DIALOGUE:
WHALE CONSCIOUSNESS (experienced as camera movement): Divine acceptance flowing as spatial journey from maritime death toward terrestrial survival benefit.

SOUNDS:
Whale consciousness producing 40Hz divine frequency as death-energy travels through environmental circulation. Brain neural activity creating crystalline music during sacrifice decision-making. Consciousness flow generating harmonic sequence as divine thought travels from ocean toward land settlements.

TECHNICAL (NEGATIVE PROMPT):
no mechanical camera movement, no traditional tracking shots, no external observation perspective, no unconscious whale death, no random movement direction

CREATIVE NOTES:
Transforms whale hunt from observed violence into experienced divine sacrifice, camera becoming whale consciousness during willing death for human benefit, consciousness flow serving as impossible camera movement connecting maritime sacrifice to terrestrial survival across impossible distance, divine awareness as camera trajectory rather than observed subject.
