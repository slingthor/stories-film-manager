VEO3 CHARACTER CONSISTENCY OPTIMIZATION

**Research Integration:**
- "The more unique and specific descriptions, the better VEO3 maintains visual continuity"
- "Create character reference sheets with exact wording"
- "Start with extreme physical detail - facial features precisely"
- "Include specific details about scars, freckles, unique markings with exact locations"

**Consistency Anchors (Never Change):**
- Weathered rectangular face geometry
- Broken aquiline nose bent leftward (old fishing injury)
- Steel-blue hooded eyes under heavy brow ridge
- Charcoal-grey beard reaching mid-chest
- 5'10" broad-shouldered stocky build
- Rope-scarred palms (fishing line cuts across both palms)
- Tarnished silver wedding ring left hand fourth finger
- Carved driftwood walking cane (worn handle, iron tip)

**Progressive Variables:**
- Clothing condition (clean → worn → torn → inside-out)
- Injury accumulation (rope burns → frostbite → missing tooth)
- Posture evolution (erect authority → hunched failure → predator lean → quadruped preparation)
- Tremor patterns (3Hz counting → 0Hz violence → multiple frequencies breakdown)
- Breathing rhythms (10/min authority → 8/min sheep → chaotic during breakdown)
- Eye changes (focused human → horizontal pupil progression → full ram eyes)

**Seasonal Clothing Progression:**
- **Summer:** Clean vaðmál, minimal layering, ceremonial cane use
- **Autumn:** Increased wear, additional patches, practical cane use
- **Winter:** Multiple layers, sealskin anorak, survival gear, cane as necessity
- **Sea scenes:** Stripped to essentials, wet weather gear, cane secured to boat
- **Violence scenes:** Clothing arranged for dominance, cane as weapon
- **Final scenes:** Clothing deteriorating, eventually inside-out sweater on ram body
