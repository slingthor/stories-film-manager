**Acting Enhancement:** Water as extraction victim refusing traditional fishing, maritime environment hostile to traditional methods through industrial trauma, accusation through environmental non-cooperation.

SEA 4: Supernatural Battleground (Shots 33-35 Trawler Confrontation)
SEA-BATTLE: [Extracted base] during divine/imperial conflict - water surface churning with supernatural disturbance as Jörmungandr preparation begins, temperature fluctuating wildly 2°C-8°C indicating underwater supernatural activity, visibility revealing massive serpent tail following trawler through clear water, surface creating whirlpool formation as serpent bites tail preparation, water behaving as conscious battleground between divine landvættir and imperial extraction forces, underwater pressure creating surface disturbance visible as maritime earthquake, boiling sections despite freezing air temperature indicating supernatural thermal activity, maritime environment choosing sides in cosmic conflict between traditional Iceland and imperial extraction.

**Acting Enhancement:** Water as conscious battleground between divine protection and imperial extraction, maritime environment experiencing supernatural civil war.

**CONTAMINATION SCENES: POISONED SUPERNATURAL**

SEA 5: Contaminated Divine (Shots 45-46 Bull Emergence)
SEA-CONTAMINATED: [Battle base] revealing landvættir contamination - polynya (ice hole) maintaining 37°C body temperature in -25°C air creating impossible thermal signature, water black but clear revealing contaminated divine presence beneath, oil slicks creating rainbow patterns around polynya indicating industrial contamination in sacred water, Griðungur's emergence creating supernatural thermal disturbance, divine blood entering water creating green-black contamination spreading in perfect spiral patterns, water temperature stratification with warm divine blood mixing with cold industrial contamination, maritime environment serving as revelation space for contaminated landvættir displaying industrial wounds, underwater pressure creating surface thermal springs indicating geological divine activity.

**Acting Enhancement:** Water revealing divine contamination through thermal and visual contamination patterns, maritime environment as revelation space for wounded gods.

SEA 6: Pathological Attraction (Shots 38 Return Sequence)
SEA-SEDUCTIVE: [Contaminated base] creating false attraction - contaminated water appearing more beautiful than house destination through rainbow oil contamination creating prismatic beauty, poisoned maritime environment generating false comfort for failed patriarch, industrial contamination creating visual attraction stronger than family survival instinct, water surface showing reflection of successful fishing while reality provides only contaminated failure, maritime environment offering pathological bonding with contaminated emptiness, poisoned beauty making death-space more appealing than life-space through industrial contamination aesthetic enhancement, contaminated water creating false homeland attraction through pollution beauty.

**Acting Enhancement:** Contaminated water creating pathological attraction stronger than family bonds, maritime environment offering false comfort through poisoned beauty.

**FINAL SCENES: ACCUSATION AND TRANSCENDENCE**

SEA 7: Mathematical Accusation (Shots 55-60 Ouroboros)
