PASS 3: PHYSICAL TO SHADOW REALITY DOMINANCE MORPH
Camera Transitioning from Human Performance to Animal Truth

SHOT HEADER:
Progressive State: Physical reality 40% accurate | Shadow reality 90% truthful | Animal identity emerging | 
Camera morphing into shadow dimension | Truth transferring to darkness | Performance dissolving

ENHANCED VERSION: THE TRUTH MIGRATION

SUBJECT:
Camera begins in physical reality showing family performing human domestic routine—eating, speaking, maintaining human behavioral patterns through conscious effort while camera slowly morphs into shadow dimension where identical actions reveal animal pack behavior truth. Physical world shows family as humans struggling with starvation while shadow world shows sheep herd exhibiting natural feeding hierarchy around limited resources. Camera transition reveals shadow-reality as more accurate than physical appearance: human performance covering animal behavioral truth, domestic activity disguising pack dynamics, family relationships masking herd organization through conscious human effort maintaining civilized appearance over animal reality.

ACTION:
Camera morphs gradually from physical light into shadow dimension, reality transition happening as smooth transformation rather than cut—physical world dissolving into shadow world where truth dominates appearance, animal behavior becoming primary while human behavior becomes secondary performance overlaying animal reality. During morph, family actions remain identical but meaning transforms: physical sharing becoming pack feeding, physical conversation becoming herd communication, physical spatial arrangement becoming territorial pack positioning. Shadow dimension operates on animal behavioral accuracy: showing dominance hierarchy (Magnús as alpha), submission patterns (Guðrún as subordinate), pack protection (children clustering), territorial spacing (Sigrid maintaining prey distance) while physical dimension maintains human domestic interpretation of identical behaviors.

SCENE:
Baðstofa interior during reality transition from human domestic space to animal pack territory, shadow dimension revealing domestic arrangements as pack behavioral patterns, family relationships showing animal hierarchy truth beneath human social performance.

STYLE:
Camera morphing from physical light into shadow dimension using impossible reality transition capability (that's where the camera is), gradual transformation from human interpretation to animal behavioral truth of identical actions. Movement follows reality morph from domestic observation to pack behavioral documentation. Lighting transitions from whale oil illumination to shadow-world darkness where animal truth operates.

DIALOGUE:
PHYSICAL REALITY: Normal Icelandic family conversation about survival.
SHADOW REALITY (overlapping): Animal pack communication about feeding hierarchy and territorial maintenance.

SOUNDS:
Reality morphing creating acoustic transition from human domestic sounds to animal pack behavioral audio—same actions producing different acoustic interpretation depending on reality framework. Physical world hearing human speech morphing into shadow world hearing pack communication, identical vocal actions interpreted through human versus animal behavioral context.

TECHNICAL (NEGATIVE PROMPT):
no obvious transformation effects, no digital morphing visible, no reality hierarchy preference, no single interpretation dominance, no normal shadow behavior

CREATIVE NOTES:
Serves story by revealing family's animal nature as primary reality with human behavior as performance overlay, shadow-truth dominating physical appearance, establishing transformation as revelation rather than change—family discovering they were always animals performing human roles, preparing for physical transformation that will align bodies with consciousness reality already operating through pack behavioral patterns visible in shadow dimension.
