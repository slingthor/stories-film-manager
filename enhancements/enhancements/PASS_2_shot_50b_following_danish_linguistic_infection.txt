PASS 2: SHOT 50B - FOLLOWING DANISH LINGUISTIC INFECTION
Camera Riding Colonial Language as It Possesses Intimate Speech

SHOT HEADER:
Progressive State: Language 80% contaminated | Danish administrative register active | Colonial possession spreading | 
Camera riding linguistic contamination | Imperial vocabulary infecting intimacy | Administrative violence operating

ENHANCED VERSION: RIDING THE LANGUAGE VIRUS

SUBJECT:
Camera following Danish administrative language as it infiltrates and possesses Magnús's intimate conversation with Sigrid—riding colonial vocabulary as moving entity that converts Icelandic endearments into imperial livestock evaluation terms, linguistic contamination spreading through domestic speech while speaker remains unconscious of possession. Camera experiences language invasion: Icelandic words beginning normally then morphing into Danish administrative register mid-syllable, colonial vocabulary hijacking intimate conversation for bureaucratic livestock assessment. Administrative language operates as conscious entity directing speech content: converting father-daughter affection into breeding-stock evaluation, traditional storytelling into colonial documentation, intimate touch into livestock inspection through linguistic possession controlling meaning while maintaining appearance of domestic intimacy.

ACTION:
Camera rides Danish language possession as it converts Icelandic intimacy into administrative documentation—following colonial vocabulary as it infiltrates domestic conversation, riding linguistic contamination as moving entity that transforms meaning while preserving surface appearance. Administrative register activates during touching: hand contact triggering bureaucratic vocabulary automatically, physical intimacy causing colonial language possession, livestock evaluation terms emerging through intimate contact. Camera experiences language switching: riding Icelandic endearments as they morph into Danish administrative assessment, linguistic contamination creating meaning conversion where love-language becomes ownership-language through colonial vocabulary possession. Temperature drop (-25°C) accompanies Danish language activation, colonial speech creating environmental coldness, administrative vocabulary affecting physical temperature through linguistic environmental contamination.

SCENE:
Sigrid's sleeping platform during linguistic colonial possession where intimate conversation serves administrative livestock evaluation through Danish vocabulary infiltrating domestic speech, colonial language converting intimacy into bureaucratic documentation while maintaining appearance of family affection.

STYLE:
Camera riding linguistic contamination using impossible language-following perspective (that's where the camera is), movement traveling with colonial vocabulary as it possesses intimate speech. Focus follows language switching showing Danish administrative register infiltrating Icelandic conversation. Movement determined by linguistic contamination flow rather than physical conversation development.

DIALOGUE:
MAGNÚS (language switching unconsciously): "Þú ert... [Danish] avlsdyr af fremragende kvalitet... [Icelandic] mín dóttir..." (You are... breeding stock of excellent quality... my daughter...)

SOUNDS:
Language switching producing acoustic contamination—Icelandic words at 200Hz frequency morphing into Danish administrative terms at 300Hz, colonial vocabulary creating acoustic signature of linguistic possession. Temperature drop during Danish activation producing 800Hz crystallization sounds as colonial speech creates environmental freezing.

TECHNICAL (NEGATIVE PROMPT):
no conscious language switching, no single language consistency, no warm intimate temperature, no normal conversation development, no language awareness

CREATIVE NOTES:
Serves story by showing colonial possession operating through linguistic contamination of intimate family speech, administrative language hijacking domestic conversation for livestock evaluation, imperial vocabulary converting love into ownership through bureaucratic possession, establishing linguistic colonization as preparation for physical colonization where Danish counting will enable family categorization as livestock through administrative mathematical contamination.
