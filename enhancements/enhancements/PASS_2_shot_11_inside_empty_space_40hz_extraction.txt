PASS 2: SHOT 11 - INSIDE EMPTY SPACE 40HZ EXTRACTION
Camera Perspective from Within Industrial Emptiness

SHOT HEADER:
Progressive State: Emptiness 40Hz mechanical | Industrial extraction acoustic signature | Missing abundance documented | 
Camera inside absent food | Trawler frequency resonating | Mechanical hunger operating

ENHANCED VERSION: THE EXTRACTION CHAMBER

SUBJECT:
Camera positioned inside empty shelf space where food should exist, revealing emptiness as active industrial mechanism rather than passive absence—void space resonating with 40Hz trawler frequency, mechanical extraction continuing to operate through acoustic signature maintaining connection between domestic emptiness and maritime resource theft. Empty space shows invisible infrastructure: geometric patterns where food containers once existed creating phantom architecture, absence organized into mathematical formations suggesting systematic removal rather than natural consumption. Through emptiness perspective, mouse droppings arranged in Danish numerical formations appear as administrative documentation—"EN TO TRE FIRE FEM SEKS" spelled in biological materials, colonial counting contaminating pest waste through imperial mathematics affecting organic materials at bureaucratic level.

ACTION:
Empty space pulses with 40Hz trawler frequency, void resonating with maritime extraction rhythm continuing domestic resource removal through acoustic connection to British trawling operation 400km distant. Phantom food containers become briefly visible through emptiness memory—ghostly impressions of abundance that existed before extraction, empty space retaining dimensional memory of resources now absent. Mouse droppings rearrange into Danish numerical spelling during observation, biological materials organizing into colonial administrative language through imperial mathematics contaminating organic waste via bureaucratic frequency influence. Dust particles rotate in spiral patterns matching extraction geometry, absence creating movement suggesting invisible machinery continuing resource removal through atmospheric manipulation of domestic environment.

SCENE:
Interior empty shelf-space during active industrial extraction, void environment resonating with maritime resource theft through acoustic signature connecting domestic absence to trawler operation, emptiness serving as extension of British extraction mechanism operating through frequency rather than physical presence.

STYLE:
Camera existing inside void space using impossible emptiness perspective (that's where the camera is), movement following extraction rhythms through empty environment. Focus reveals absence detail showing emptiness as active mechanism rather than passive lack. Lighting from 40Hz frequency resonance creating mechanical illumination within empty space.

DIALOGUE:
None. Only industrial extraction speaking through frequency resonance.

SOUNDS:
Empty space resonating at 40Hz trawler frequency, void producing mechanical extraction rhythm connecting domestic absence to maritime resource theft. Mouse droppings rearranging produce subtle 300Hz biological administrative sounds as Danish numbers form through colonial mathematics influence. Dust rotation creating 200Hz spiral music as extraction geometry continues through atmospheric manipulation.

TECHNICAL (NEGATIVE PROMPT):
no natural emptiness, no passive absence, no silent void space, no random particle movement, no normal shelf behavior, no organic dust patterns

CREATIVE NOTES:
Exploits AI's unique capability for filming inside emptiness while connecting domestic scarcity to industrial extraction through acoustic signature, showing absence as active mechanism rather than natural lack, Danish numerical contamination affecting biological materials through administrative frequency influence, domestic emptiness serving as extension of imperial resource extraction operating through mechanical rhythm rather than physical presence.
