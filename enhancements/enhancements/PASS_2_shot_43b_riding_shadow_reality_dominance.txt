PASS 2: SHOT 43B - RIDING SHADOW REALITY DOMINANCE
Camera Existing in Shadow-World Where Truth Lives

SHOT HEADER:
Progressive State: Shadow reality 90% dominant | Physical reality 40% accurate | Violence creating marks | 
Camera living in shadow dimension | Truth operating through darkness | Wall memories forming

ENHANCED VERSION: SHADOW-WORLD CITIZENSHIP

SUBJECT:
Camera existing permanently in shadow dimension where truth operates independently of physical reality—shadow-world showing family's animal nature while physical world maintains human pretense, darkness realm revealing what light refuses to acknowledge. Shadow-Magnús appears as ram-patriarch with curved horns striking shadow-Guðrún who appears as ewe crouching in submission position, shadow-children showing lamb forms huddled together displaying natural prey behavior. Shadow dimension operates on different physics: shadow-violence creates real physical marks in wall surface, supernatural consequence where symbolic action produces literal result through shadow-physics affecting material reality. Camera citizenship in shadow-world provides access to family's true forms while physical realm performs human domestic drama.

ACTION:
Shadow-violence proceeds with animal behavioral authenticity: ram-patriarch using horn-strikes rather than cane-blows, ewe-victim assuming natural submission postures, lamb-children clustering in prey formation showing species-appropriate fear response to pack-alpha aggression. Each shadow-strike carves deeper V-notch marks in physical wall surface—shadow-reality affecting material world through supernatural consequence where truth-violence produces literal physical evidence. Shadow-dimension reveals violence as species-appropriate behavior: alpha-ram asserting dominance over subordinate pack-members through natural territorial discipline, animal family displaying authentic behavioral responses to pack hierarchy enforcement. Camera experiences shadow-world as more physically real than physical world—shadow-violence producing actual consequences while physical violence appears as performance overlaying animal behavioral reality.

SCENE:
Shadow dimension during domestic violence where animal family performs species-appropriate dominance hierarchy while physical world maintains human domestic performance, shadow-reality providing access to authentic behavioral truth underlying human social pretense.

STYLE:
Camera permanently resident in shadow dimension using impossible shadow-world perspective (that's where the camera is), observing physical reality through shadow-truth lens showing family's animal nature operating beneath human performance. Movement follows shadow-physics where symbolic action creates literal consequence. Lighting entirely from shadow-world illumination revealing darkness as primary reality containing physical world as secondary performance.

DIALOGUE:
None in human language. Only animal communication: ram-patriarch producing dominance sounds, ewe-victim creating submission vocalizations, lamb-children making prey-clustering noises.

SOUNDS:
Shadow-violence producing authentic animal behavioral audio: horn-strikes creating 400Hz bone-impact sounds, submission responses generating 300Hz prey-acknowledgment, territorial dominance assertion producing 200Hz alpha-vocalization. Physical wall receiving shadow-violence produces 600Hz carving sounds as V-notch marks form through supernatural consequence.

TECHNICAL (NEGATIVE PROMPT):
no human behavioral interpretation, no domestic violence context, no social dysfunction framework, no civilized interaction, no human emotional responses

CREATIVE NOTES:
Serves story by revealing family's animal nature as primary reality with human behavior as secondary performance, shadow-world providing access to authentic species identity that physical world disguises, violence appearing as natural pack hierarchy rather than social dysfunction, preparing audience for understanding transformation as revealing rather than changing essential nature.
