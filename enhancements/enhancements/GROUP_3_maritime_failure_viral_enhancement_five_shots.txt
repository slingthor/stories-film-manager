SUBJECT:
Magnus invoking aflausn (supernatural strength) but time flowing at multiple rates during berserker activation—his muscles expanding in slow-motion while rope-pulling happens real-time creating temporal distortion where different body parts experience different time-flow rates, supernatural strength creating selective time manipulation impossible with normal physics. Material transmutation during strength surge: muscle tissue temporarily displaying stone-like hardness, skin showing metal-like tensile strength, bone structure revealing crystalline enhancement through berserker material consciousness, human anatomy experiencing supernatural material upgrade through aflausn activation. Age acceleration visible as streaming temporal effect: decades of aging flowing from future-self toward present-body creating visible temporal contamination, life-force expenditure apparent as time-stream corruption affecting physical appearance through supernatural strength cost.
