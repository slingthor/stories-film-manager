SHOT 1C-E: THE BLOOD CARTOGRAPHY
Progressive State: Whale blood 100% divine | Mathematical patterns self-organizing | Navigation system activating | 
Camera following liquid impossibility | Sacred geometry teaching | Blood consciousness directing

SUBJECT:
Hafstrambur's blood flowing from three spear wounds but behaving like liquid silk—blood maintaining coherent sheet-like surface tension while flowing in impossible mathematical patterns across black volcanic sand. Blood-sheet peels and folds creating three-dimensional origami geometry spelling landvættir names in crimson script, liquid crimson maintaining fabric-like behavior while preserving blood characteristics. Camera follows blood mathematics as patterns scale-jump from molecular detail to landscape geography: macro view showing blood cells arranging in runic formations, expanding to reveal beach-scale navigation patterns, further expanding to show fjord-system geometry matching blood flow mathematics, demonstrating universal mathematical template operating from cellular to cosmic scale.

ACTION:
Blood-sheet origami unfolds across beach creating navigation cartography for community processing organization—liquid crimson peeling like fabric to reveal three-layer blood map: SURFACE shows immediate processing locations, MIDDLE LAYER reveals seasonal hunting territories, DEEP LAYER exposes ancient sacrifice sites connected through underground blood mathematics. Scale-jumping camera follows blood pattern expansion: beginning inside blood droplet showing cellular organization, morphing through beach surface pattern, expanding to aerial perspective revealing entire Westfjords geography following identical mathematical template. Blood consciousness directs community movement through origami geography—liquid cartography teaching optimal processing locations, seasonal territory organization, ancient sacrifice integration through divine blood serving as environmental GPS system.

SCENE:
Black volcanic sand beach where divine blood creates liquid cartography teaching community organization through origami blood-sheet mathematics, sacred geometry operating from cellular to geographical scale serving traditional cooperation enhancement.

STYLE:
Camera following blood scale-jumping expansion using impossible perspective morphing (that's where the camera is), macro-to-cosmic transitions following mathematical pattern consistency. Movement determined by blood cartography expansion rather than traditional tracking. Natural lighting enhanced by blood luminescence and origami geometry self-illumination.

DIALOGUE:
None. Blood mathematics communicating through liquid cartography without language.

SOUNDS:
Blood-sheet origami creating textile sounds as liquid crimson folds like fabric, scale-jumping expansion producing harmonic sequence from cellular 1000Hz to geographical 200Hz, blood consciousness producing navigation audio through mathematical pattern completion.

Progressive State: Egg mathematics impossible | Collection 120% successful | Reproductive abundance false | 
Camera experiencing nest dimension-shifting | Fertility contamination spreading | Imperial abundance enabling

SUBJECT:
Children collecting seabird eggs from cliff nests, but 2D nest-holes transforming into impossible 3D dimensional spaces—flat cliff face opening into deep nest-chambers extending beyond geological possibility, cliff wall containing architectural nest-systems impossible with natural rock formation. Six eggs collected from five visible nests through nest multiplication: camera witnesses egg-collection but 2D cliff face transforms providing 3D access to additional nest-spaces existing in dimensional expansion beyond normal cliff capacity. Eggs show material contamination: shells appearing normal limestone but cracking reveal crystalline interiors containing industrial materials—brass mechanical centers, rope-fiber yolks, coal-dust albumin, traditional eggs corrupted with imperial materials through atmospheric contamination affecting reproductive biology.

ACTION:
Cliff face 2D-to-3D transformation enables impossible egg access: flat rock surface opening into deep nest-chambers containing additional eggs beyond natural cliff nesting capacity, dimensional expansion providing extra reproductive resources through supernatural abundance enhancement. Infinite zoom into collected eggs reveals internal contamination: camera diving into normal-appearing shell discovering crystalline architecture containing imperial materials, microscopic examination showing brass machinery where yolk should exist, rope fibers forming albumin network, coal particles creating shell strength enhancement. Scale-jumping between egg collection (normal activity) and internal examination (contamination revelation) shows traditional food sources corrupted by industrial atmospheric pollution affecting reproductive biology at cellular level.

SCENE:
Cliff face during impossible egg collection where 2D geology transforms to accommodate extra reproductive abundance, traditional gathering enhanced by dimensional expansion enabling surplus collection through supernatural cliff cooperation.

STYLE:
Camera following 2D-to-3D cliff transformation using impossible dimensional expansion capability (that's where the camera is), flat-surface morphing into architectural nest-system. Movement includes infinite zoom into egg contamination revealing industrial corruption at cellular scale. Focus maintains clarity during dimensional transformation and scale-jumping examination.

Camera trapped in observation loop | Sixth presence confirming | Watching-within-watching active

SUBJECT:
Family around table viewed through south window, but window glass behaving as recursive dimensional portal—camera looking through window reveals family scene, but family members looking back through same window creating infinite recursion of observation where camera watches family watching camera through window creating endless surveillance loop. Window reflection shows six family members while direct view shows five, reflection-reality operating independently with mathematical accuracy showing imperial presence invisible to direct observation. Selective freeze frame during counting: Magnus's mathematical confusion creates temporal pause where everyone except Sigrid freezes mid-gesture, Sigrid continuing normal movement during family mathematical breakdown demonstrating her immunity to imperial counting contamination affecting family temporal stability.

ACTION:
Window recursion reveals surveillance infinity: camera observing family through window while family observes camera through same window creating dimensional surveillance loop where observation multiplies through recursive reflection, watching-within-watching creating mathematical infinity of mutual observation. Freeze frame selectivity during counting confusion: family temporal stability breaking under mathematical impossibility while Sigrid maintains normal time-flow, imperial counting affecting family temporal consistency while witness-consciousness operates immune to administrative temporal manipulation. Window reflection independence showing six while direct shows five demonstrates mathematical contamination affecting reflection-reality differently than physical reality, mirror-dimension accommodating impossible mathematics while physical dimension struggles with counting contamination.
