PASS 2: SHOT 6A - NEUROTOXIN CRYSTAL FORMATION INSIDE BERRIES
Camera Inside Berry During Contamination Chemistry

SHOT HEADER:
Progressive State: Berry chemistry 90% contaminated | Neurotoxin crystals forming | Women hallucinating | 
Camera inside fruit cellular structure | Industrial chemistry biological | Molecular contamination spreading

RESEARCH INTEGRATION:
Using hákarl bacterial research showing how contaminated chemistry creates complex molecular changes (trimethylamine transformation), applied to crowberries developing industrial neurotoxin crystals through atmospheric contamination from British trawler emissions.

ENHANCED VERSION: THE CRYSTAL POISON GARDEN

SUBJECT:
Camera inside individual crowberry during contamination crystal formation, revealing fruit interior as complex chemical laboratory where atmospheric industrial pollution (coal emissions, brass particles, rope chemicals) has created artificial bacterial communities that generate neurotoxin crystals within organic berry structure. Interior cellular landscape shows contaminated bacterial ecosystem—foreign microorganisms (British industrial bacteria) invading native berry bacteria, creating hybrid bacterial community that produces geometric crystal formations instead of natural berry chemistry. Neurotoxin crystals grow in real-time through bacterial manipulation of berry chemistry, geometric formations spelling British Admiralty codes in microscopic crystalline script, industrial contamination creating administrative messages within traditional food through bacterial colonization of organic chemistry.

ACTION:
Berry chemistry transformation visible at cellular level—native bacteria being consumed by industrial bacterial invaders, organic ecosystem replaced by contaminated microbiome designed for crystal production rather than nutritional chemistry. Neurotoxin crystals form through bacterial construction—microorganisms building geometric structures within berry cells, chemical contamination creating mathematical patterns that match réttir sorting geometry, traditional food becoming administrative documentation through bacterial writing. Camera follows crystal formation process showing industrial bacteria organizing berry chemistry into neurotoxic compounds, contaminated microorganisms serving imperial contamination agenda through biological manipulation of traditional food sources. Crystal growth creates internal berry architecture—geometric chambers within fruit structure containing concentrated neurotoxin that will enable family's mathematical breakdown and counting confusion, traditional food becoming chemical weapon through atmospheric contamination.

SCENE:
Microscopic interior of contaminated berry where industrial pollution has corrupted cellular chemistry through bacterial invasion, traditional food source transformed into neurotoxin production facility through atmospheric contamination affecting organic chemistry at bacterial level.

STYLE:
Camera navigating berry interior using impossible cellular perspective (that's where the camera is), movement following bacterial contamination pathways through organic tissue. Focus reveals crystal formation detail showing bacterial construction of geometric neurotoxin structures. Lighting from bioluminescent contaminated bacteria creating artificial illumination within organic environment.

DIALOGUE:
None. Bacterial contamination communicating through chemical crystal formation.

SOUNDS:
Industrial bacteria producing 350Hz mechanical frequency versus native bacteria at 250Hz, contaminated microbiome creating acoustic signature of cellular colonization. Crystal formation producing 500Hz geometric resonance as neurotoxin structures grow within berry cells. Chemical reactions creating subtle bubbling sounds at 400Hz as industrial contamination transforms organic chemistry.

TECHNICAL (NEGATIVE PROMPT):
no normal berry chemistry, no pure organic bacteria, no natural crystal formation, no uncontaminated cellular structure, no traditional food chemistry

CREATIVE NOTES:
Integrates fermentation bacterial research showing complex microorganism communities creating chemical transformation, perverted to show industrial contamination corrupting traditional food through bacterial invasion, creating neurotoxin chemistry that enables family's mathematical breakdown while appearing as normal traditional food preparation, atmospheric pollution affecting food sources at cellular level through bacterial ecosystem replacement serving imperial contamination agenda.
