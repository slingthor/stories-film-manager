BAÐSTOFA ENVIRONMENTAL PLATE SYSTEM
Progressive Bergrisi Body Interior to Obsidian Klettagjá Transformation

RESEARCH FOUNDATION:
- Baðstofa progressively reveals true nature as Bergrisi's body interior
- House transforms into klettagjá (obsidian cliff cleft) as giant crystallizes into monument
- No marine elements - pure geological cliff formation with obsidian growth
- Seven warm spots (37°C) = Bergrisi's organs pulsing with life then crystallizing
- Camera position considerations for each scene's perspective and lighting needs
