PASS 2: SHOT 30 - TIME RIDING REFLECTION AGING
Camera Following Temporal Contamination Through Mirror-Reality

SHOT HEADER:
Progressive State: Time 40% non-linear | Reflection aging independent | Mirror-reality accelerated | 
Camera riding temporal contamination | Age differential spreading | Reflection-truth dominance

ENHANCED VERSION: CHASING ACCELERATED TIME

SUBJECT:
Camera riding temporal contamination as it affects reflection differently than physical reality—following time-sickness as it creates aging differential between Magnús's body (normal wear) and reflection (decades accumulation), temporal splitting where mirror-reality experiences accelerated aging while physical reality maintains normal time progression. Reflection ages 5 years per fishing attempt while body accumulates normal fatigue, temporal contamination affecting mirror-dimension through mathematical impossibility contaminating time itself. Camera experiences temporal riding: moving with accelerated aging as it affects reflection-reality, following time-contamination as visible entity spreading through mirror-physics, temporal breakdown creating different aging rates for body versus reflection through mathematical contamination affecting dimensional consistency.

ACTION:
Camera follows temporal contamination as it creates reflection aging acceleration—riding time-sickness as moving entity that affects mirror-reality independently of physical reality, temporal breakdown spreading through reflection-dimension causing aging differential. Each fishing attempt triggers reflection aging: mirror-self accumulating decades while physical body experiences normal fatigue, temporal contamination creating identity split where reflection shows true cost while body shows performance version. Camera chases temporal anomaly as it spreads: sun flickering backward creating time-hiccup, ravens disappearing/reappearing through temporal glitch, wake flowing wrong direction as physics breakdown spreads from mathematical contamination to environmental systems. Temporal riding reveals time itself infected by counting impossibility: mathematical breakdown affecting temporal consistency, imperial arithmetic contaminating natural law through administrative temporal manipulation.

SCENE:
Empty fjord serving as temporal laboratory where mathematical contamination affects time-flow differently for reflection versus physical reality, mirror-dimension experiencing accelerated aging while body-dimension maintains normal temporal progression, time-sickness spreading through environmental systems.

STYLE:
Camera riding temporal contamination using impossible time-following perspective (that's where the camera is), movement traveling with time-sickness as it affects reflection aging acceleration. Focus follows temporal differential between body and reflection, showing aging contamination spreading through mirror-reality. Movement determined by temporal contamination flow rather than physical boat movement.

DIALOGUE:
MAGNÚS (to his ancient reflection): "Þú ert eldri..." (You are older...)
REFLECTION-MAGNÚS (aged voice): "Ég sé hvað kemur..." (I see what comes...)

SOUNDS:
Temporal contamination producing 528Hz frequency as time-sickness spreads through reflection-reality creating aging acceleration. Reflection aging creating subtle crackling sounds at 400Hz as mirror-dimension accumulates decades. Time-hiccup during sun reversal producing Doppler effect on environmental sounds.

TECHNICAL (NEGATIVE PROMPT):
no normal aging rates, no consistent temporal flow, no stable reflection behavior, no natural time progression, no unified body-reflection aging

CREATIVE NOTES:
Serves story by showing mathematical contamination affecting time itself through reflection-reality experiencing accelerated consequences while physical reality maintains false stability, temporal breakdown spreading from counting impossibility to environmental physics, reflection-truth revealing actual cost while body-truth maintains performance version, preparing for complete temporal breakdown during transformation where past/present/future operate simultaneously.
