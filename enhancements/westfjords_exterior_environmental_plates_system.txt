WESTFJORDS-MASTER: Hornstrandir Peninsula Westfjords location at coordinates 65°31'48"N 23°47'24"W, ancient geological landscape formed by basalt volcanic activity showing massive tabletop mountains with sheer cliff faces dropping 300-500 meters directly to sea level, no vegetation except scattered hardy arctic grass in summer, landscape dominated by black volcanic rock formations and grey basalt columns creating natural geometric architecture, dramatic fjord systems with narrow water channels between towering cliff walls, Denmark Strait visible extending toward Greenland coast 300km northeast, pack ice formation visible offshore during winter months (Klaki period), British trawler GRIMSBY PRIDE positioned 1.3 nautical miles offshore appearing serpent-like through distance distortion and horizontal snow interference, nearest human settlement 8km southeast completely invisible across mountain barriers, landscape showing evidence of geological violence through cliff formation, volcanic history, and dramatic erosion patterns creating natural amphitheater geography, snow accumulation on horizontal surfaces only (cliff faces too steep for snow retention), wind patterns channeled through fjord geography creating horizontal snow transport and complex acoustic effects, visibility severely limited by weather conditions and geographical barriers creating complete isolation environment.

GEOLOGICAL DETAILS: Black basalt bedrock exposed through snow, grey volcanic rock formations creating natural geometric patterns, dramatic cliff architecture formed by volcanic cooling and erosion, natural stone columns and formations suggesting ancient construction, tabletop mountain geography with flat summits and vertical cliff faces, fjord water black and deep surrounded by vertical stone walls, natural rock formations creating wind channels and acoustic phenomena.

WEATHER CONSTANTS: Subarctic maritime climate with extreme winter conditions, northeast wind patterns from Denmark Strait, horizontal snow transport, visibility severely limited during storm conditions, temperature extremes requiring survival expertise, weather changing rapidly through fjord geographical effects.

WINTER ENVIRONMENTAL PLATE (February 13-14, 1888)

WESTFJORDS-WINTER: [Master base] during Klaki winter maximum - temperature range -18°C to -25°C creating life-threatening cold, northeast wind sustained 40mph with gusts to 60mph channeled through fjord geography creating horizontal ice needle transport, heavy wet snow falling horizontally with zero visibility periods dropping to 20-50 meters making navigation impossible, pack ice extending from shore 2-3km offshore with pressure ridges and ice mountains creating white maze, British trawler GRIMSBY PRIDE barely visible through snow at 1.3 nautical miles appearing as dark serpent coiled against white pack ice, dramatic basalt cliffs black with snow accumulation only on horizontal ledges creating stark black/white contrast, volcanic rock formations providing minimal wind shelter creating survival pockets, fjord water black and steaming from temperature differential with ice, snow drifts accumulating against cliff faces creating sculpted white architecture, aurora borealis occasionally visible through snow clouds creating green light reflection on ice formations, landscape completely hostile to human survival requiring shelter or death within hours, no wildlife visible except occasional arctic fox tracks in protected areas, wind sound creating geological symphony through cliff formations and fjord channels producing haunting acoustic signatures at multiple frequencies, visibility changes creating landscape appearing/disappearing through weather creating psychological disorientation, pack ice shifting and grinding audible as geological percussion.

**Camera Considerations:** Extreme weather cinematography requiring protection for equipment, horizontal snow affecting visibility creating natural diffusion, dramatic contrast between black rock and white snow/ice, lighting from aurora reflection and ice luminescence.

**Specific Geological Features:**
- **Tabletop mountains:** 400-600m flat summits with vertical cliff faces
- **Basalt columns:** Natural geometric formations suggesting ancient architecture  
- **Cliff amphitheaters:** Natural wind protection creating survival pockets
- **Volcanic beaches:** Black sand and stone providing coastal access
- **Ice formations:** Pack ice pressure ridges creating white mountain landscape
- **Fjord channels:** Deep black water channels between cliff walls

SUMMER ENVIRONMENTAL PLATE (Impossible Abundance Version)

WESTFJORDS-SUMMER: [Master base] during false golden memory - temperature impossible 12-15°C creating shirt-sleeve comfort at subarctic latitude, wind calm 5mph providing gentle breeze instead of survival threat, visibility unlimited with crystal clarity allowing 50km vision across Denmark Strait, pack ice absent with warm blue water reaching shore, British presence invisible or appearing as protective escort vessel, basalt cliffs covered with impossible green grass creating Ireland-like landscape, volcanic rock formations decorated with arctic flowers blooming in mathematical patterns, fjord water warm enough for swimming with abundant fish jumping visibly, snow absent except on distant mountain peaks creating postcard beauty, aurora borealis visible during midnight sun creating impossible celestial display, landscape offering abundance through easy hunting, fishing, gathering, no survival threat requiring constant vigilance, wildlife abundant with seabirds, arctic foxes, seals visible creating Disney nature documentary environment, wind creating musical harmony through cliff formations instead of survival threat, perfect weather conditions enabling effortless outdoor activity, landscape cooperating with human desire rather than threatening survival.

**Camera Considerations:** Golden hour lighting throughout (impossible midnight sun), landscape beauty cinematography, postcard tourism photography, no survival threat creating relaxed filming conditions.

**Predatory Seduction Elements:** Everything too perfect, too abundant, too cooperative - landscape performing beauty rather than displaying authentic harshness, false memory creating impossible environmental conditions.
