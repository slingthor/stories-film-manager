      "action": "Magn\u00fas kneels on thick grass. Spreads rope in front of him. J\u00f3n kneels opposite, watching intently. Magn\u00fas's large hands take rope end. Forms loop. Passes end through. Pulls to create bowline knot. Unties it. Hands rope to J\u00f3n. Boy's smaller hands try to copy. Makes wrong loop. Magn\u00fas places his hands over boy's, guides them. Together they form knot correctly. Magn\u00fas nods once. Takes rope back. Shows second knot - clove hitch. More complex. J\u00f3n watches every movement. Behind them, cliff edge drops straight down. Ocean below shows whale's blood trail now reaching beach, spreading along shoreline. Other men visible as dots preparing flensing area. Women disappeared toward purple hills. Magn\u00fas ties rope around J\u00f3n's waist, through legs, creating harness. Tests each loop. Boy stands still, trusting.",
