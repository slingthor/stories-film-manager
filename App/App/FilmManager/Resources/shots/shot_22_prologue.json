Sigrid's face - but now older, 30, 40, 50 years old in flashes. House behind her now huge, breathing, walls expanding and contracting. Through lit window, shadows moving inside - five figures, or four, or six. Can't count. Frost continues spreading. Only center of lens clear. Through it: Sigrid now ancient, hair white, still singing same song. Behind her, house door opens. Yellow light spills out. Someone standing in doorway - Magn\u00fas? But wrong. Too tall. Too many arms? Or is it sheep standing upright? Frost covers more. Through last clear spot: interior of house visible. Family at table. But are they human? Shapes wrong. Frost nearly complete. Final image: single eye looking directly at camera. Human? Sheep? Sigrid's? Ancient. Knowing. Frost covers completely. Darkness.",
