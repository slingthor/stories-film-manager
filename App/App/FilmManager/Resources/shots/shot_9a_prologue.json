      "action": "Sun breaks from frozen position. Drops 10 degrees in one second. Shadows from tables suddenly swing eastward, moving like clock hands. Golden light shifts orange. Everyone still frozen at tables but shadows moving around them. Sun drops another 10 degrees. Light turns deep red. Food on tables changes - whale meat darkening, berries shriveling, eggs turning grey. Sun continues plummet. Sky shifts red to purple. Temperature drops - breath becomes visible from everyone simultaneously, white clouds in purple air. Frost forms on table edges, spreading inward. Purple juice in cups freezes, expanding, some cups cracking. Sun nearly at horizon now. Moving faster. The searchlight still locked on feast but overwhelmed by dying natural light. Children begin shivering. Adults don't move. Sun touches horizon. Pauses one second. Then drops below. Darkness rushing in from edges of frame.",
