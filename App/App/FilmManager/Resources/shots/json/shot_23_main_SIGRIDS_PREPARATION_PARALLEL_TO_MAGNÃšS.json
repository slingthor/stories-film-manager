      "action": "Family begins ritual simultaneously, each corner's offering requiring specific traditional gesture contaminated by imperial materials. Magn\u00fas raises blood-bowl but coal dust makes liquid too thick, requiring both hands instead of traditional single-hand offering. Gu\u00f0r\u00fan wraps wool around button but brass grows warm from handling, singing her fingers and making wool smoke slightly. Sigrid opens breath-bag but industrial vapor escapes first, choking her before pure breath can be offered. Children carve names but Danish steel tools create wrong rune-shapes, traditional letters becoming foreign marks. Each offering struggles against contamination while family maintains ritual precision, traditional knowledge fighting imperial materials. House responds to coordinated ritual by breathing faster\u201415 to 18/min anxiety\u2014Bergrisi sensing contaminated offerings approaching his corners. Four landv\u00e6ttir respond to summoning but each emergence shows industrial contamination damage\u2014gods poisoned by imperial materials used in offerings. Raven-shadow (Gammur) moves wrong, wings stuttering like mechanical failure. House-voice (Bergrisi) speaks Danish words mixed with Old Norse, linguistic colonization affecting divine speech. Trawler-presence (J\u00f6rmungandr) approaches but movement shows serpent-pain, divine swimming corrupted by industrial wounds. Ice-breathing (Gri\u00f0ungur) produces steam mixed with coal smoke, pure glacier-breath contaminated by trawler pollution. Fifth spirit (tilberi) emerges unexpectedly at center where four contaminated offerings converge, creating mathematical impossibility\u2014four corners producing five responses, traditional ritual mathematics broken by imperial contamination. Family realizes ritual succeeded but wrongly, summoning contaminated gods instead of pure guardians, protection arriving as additional threat.",

Opens old box: ritual materials mixed with industrial contamination. Takes sheep rib (from breakfast, still has meat threads). Unravels wool from Magn\u00c3\u00bas's spare sweater (grey with coal dust). Finds rope - but it's from boat supplies, hemp mixed with tar, industrial. Brass button green with verdigris, not bone. Arranges them on floor in pattern from book - but pattern wrong because materials wrong. Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban watches, knows what's coming, but stays silent. Women don't speak. Sigrid traces pattern in dust, accidentally makes six points instead of five. Through window, trawler beam illuminates materials - under industrial light, contamination visible. Black fibers through rope, green oxidation on brass, coal dust in wool. Her breathing 15/min (never changes), but baby's heartbeat audible in silence - 140bpm, twice mother's rate. House breathing slows to 8/min, preparing.",
