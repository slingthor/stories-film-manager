Each shadow-strike carves deeper V-notch marks in physical wall surface\u2014shadow-reality affecting material world through supernatural consequence where truth-violence produces literal physical evidence. Shadow-dimension reveals violence as species-appropriate behavior: alpha-ram asserting dominance over subordinate pack-members through natural territorial discipline, animal family displaying authentic behavioral responses to pack hierarchy enforcement.
