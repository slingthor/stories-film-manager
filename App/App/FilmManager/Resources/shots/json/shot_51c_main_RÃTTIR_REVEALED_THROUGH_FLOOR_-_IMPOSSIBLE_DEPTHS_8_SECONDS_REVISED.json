Ancient r\u00c3\u00a9ttir, the circular stone sorting pens, but 10 feet down - impossible, house is on ground level. Five stone pens radiating from center, sixth pen different - newer, Danish construction. In the pens: sheep. But wearing clothes. Ram with Magn\u00c3\u00bas's sweater. Ewe with Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban's faldb\u00c3\u00baningur. Lambs with children's dresses. Fifth pen: young ewe with subtle belly, Sigrid's dress. Sixth pen: enormous raven, watching up through floor. The sheep below move when family above moves - synchronized. Or is family moving because sheep move? Which controls which? Magn\u00c3\u00bas drops to knees, pressing hands to floor: \"Hva\u00c3\u00b0 er fyrir ne\u00c3\u00b0an?\" Through transparent section, the ram below presses hooves up. They touch through impossible space. Below the r\u00c3\u00a9ttir: glimpse of pink flesh, rhythmic pulsing. They're in Bergrisi's stomach. The r\u00c3\u00a9ttir are his digestive system. The house is his mouth.",
