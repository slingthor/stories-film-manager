But shadows on walls: perfect human silhouettes. Shadow-Magn\u00c3\u00bas standing proud. Shadow-Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban maternal. Shadow-children playing. Shadow-Sigrid apart. The shadows are more human than the bodies. Or are shadows the lie? Match dies. Darkness returns. But image burned in retina. Were they sheep casting human shadows? Humans casting sheep shadows? Both simultaneously? In that second: glimpse of Sigrid. She's... different. Not quite sheep. Not quite human. Something between. Becoming something else. Match dies. Breathing continues. Now we can't unhear the sheep quality. Can't unknow what we saw.",
