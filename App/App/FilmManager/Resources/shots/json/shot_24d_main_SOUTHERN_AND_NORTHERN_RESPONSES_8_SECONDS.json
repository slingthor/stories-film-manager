      "subject": "From south, the house itself responding as Bergrisi - floor suddenly warm and wet like flesh, walls breathing visibly, heartbeat racing through structure - while from north, a raven shadow passes the broken window, too large for any bird, wings spanning the entire house, leaving frost feathers on glass.",
      "action": "Southern response: The floor beneath Sigrid becomes body-warm, 37\u00c2\u00b0C exactly. Wet. Looking closer - not moisture but perspiration, house sweating. Walls flex inward-outward, no longer subtle but visible breathing at 4/min, dying rhythm. The three beams creak, bend, showing pink underneath bark for full second - ribs. Heartbeat through everything, 80bpm, panicking. House groaning at 16Hz, harmonizing with Sigrid's possessed voice: \"\u00c3\u2030g er h\u00c3\u00a9r... \u00c3\u00a9g dey\" (I am here... I'm dying) from the walls themselves. Northern response: Massive shadow across broken window. Raven but impossible size - wings would be 30 feet across. Shadow passes slowly, deliberately, examining house. Where shadow touches broken glass, black frost forms instantly - raven-feather patterns in ice. Shadow has substance, weight. As it passes, hundreds of normal ravens suddenly audible, circling above, cawing in unison. But shadow-raven silent. Through shadow, glimpse of eye - human eye, grey with amber flecks. Sigrid's exact eyes in raven form.",
      "scene": "Interior revealing as body cavity. Floor wet with perspiration. Walls flexing. Massive shadow passing. All four cardinal directions now responding.",
