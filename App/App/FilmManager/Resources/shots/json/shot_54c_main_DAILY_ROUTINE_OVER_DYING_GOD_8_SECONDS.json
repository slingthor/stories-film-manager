Magn\u00c3\u00bas goes out to check sky, foot on Bull's eye socket (beside the net grown into cornea). J\u00c3\u00b3n runs out to play, jumps over like game. Lands on Bull's tongue (hanging out slightly). Lilja follows, sits on Bull's neck, arranges wool sheep figurines on his head between harpoons. Playing while god dies beneath her. Each crossing wears the Bull down more. Fur rubbing off where they step. Skin underneath showing - not pink but translucent, universe visible through god's flesh. Stars. Cosmos. Swimming things. Through his body: glimpse of ocean depths, polynya, trawler in distance. He's portal between worlds. But family just sees obstacle at door. Sigrid alone treats him gently - each crossing, she whispers: \"Fyrirgef\u00c3\u00b0u\" (Forgive us). He forgives. Came here to forgive and witness. To die at threshold between old and new.",
