      "action": "CAMERA STARTS medium on Magn\u00c3\u00bas holding fin, PUSHES IN smooth and slow. As we get closer, horror reveals: Black flesh not from seal color but decomposition. Edges green with rot. Maggots throughout but frozen in ice crystals, suspended mid-movement like white rice. Smell visible as vapor rising despite cold. One maggot not frozen, still moving, blind, searching. Magn\u00c3\u00bas's 0Hz hands can't feel the slime, the texture, only sees. His aged eyes studying it like reading future. In EXTREME CLOSE-UP, we see his reflection in the ice crystals covering the rot - his face distorted, multiplied, broken into hundred fragments. This is his provision. This is what he brings home. Camera holds on this intimacy between provider and failure.",
