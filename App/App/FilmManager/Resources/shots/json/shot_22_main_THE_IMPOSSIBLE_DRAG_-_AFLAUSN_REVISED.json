      "action": "Magn\u00c3\u00bas loops rope over shoulders, tries to pull. Boat frozen to ground, won't budge. His cane tremoring at 4Hz in his grip becomes impediment. Makes decision: drives cane deep into snow as anchor point, abandoning his authority symbol for labor. Grips rope with both hands now. Pulls. Nothing. Pulls harder. Boat rocks but stuck. Then - trawler searchlight sweeps across, hits him directly. In that yellow industrial light, something changes. Old Westfjords strength - aflausn, the impossible surge fishermen know. Legends of men lifting boats, dragging whales, but always with cost. He PULLS - boat breaks free, slides 20 feet in one supernatural motion, following blood spiral perfectly. But moment light passes, he collapses to knees. Blood pours from nose, freezing instantly into red icicles on beard. Tremor worsens to 5Hz. Looks at hands - older, more weathered, as if strength borrowed from future years. Cane still standing in snow behind him, already freezing in place, becoming permanent marker. Will never retrieve it.",
      "scene": "Path from house, 6:30 AM, -25\u00c2\u00b0C. Where cane planted, ice immediately forms around it, crystallizing up shaft. Boat leaves deep groove following blood spiral. Trawler light triggers transformation - in beam, Magn\u00c3\u00bas briefly appears younger, stronger, then older when it passes. The aflausn comes from industrial light, not traditional gods - corrupted miracle.",
