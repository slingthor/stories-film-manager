      "action": "JÃ³n climbs backward down cliff, rope taut around waist. MagnÃºs above, visible hands holding rope steady. Boy's feet grip small ledges. Reaches first hole in cliff, 2 feet wide, perfectly round. Reaches in up to elbow. Pulls out three white eggs, each large as his fist. Places them in leather pouch at hip. Descends further. Second hole contains five eggs. Too many for one bird. Third egg slips from his grip. Falls 50 feet. Hits black rock below. Shell explodes. Yolk spreads bright golden across rock, running down in streams. Same color as morning sunlight. JÃ³n freezes, watching yolk spread. MagnÃºs tugs rope - continue. Boy reaches next hole. This one deeper. Entire arm disappears inside. Face shows surprise. Pulls out seven eggs. Pouch already full. Holds extra eggs against chest. One more falls. Another golden explosion on rocks. Yolk and blood from whale mixing where rock meets water.",
