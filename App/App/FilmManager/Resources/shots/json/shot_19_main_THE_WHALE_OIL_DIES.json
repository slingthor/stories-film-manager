      "action": "Door still open from Magn\u00c3\u00bas's exit. Arctic wind enters, -25\u00c2\u00b0C fighting -12\u00c2\u00b0C. The candle he used already dead. Only whale oil lamp remains, but wind finds it. Flame bends horizontal, trying to survive. Shrinks to half size. Quarter size. Pinpoint. The oil is gone - 200 years of whale oil lamps in this house, ending now. The wick glows red for moment, ember of old world. Then black. Complete darkness. Through open door, sound of Magn\u00c3\u00bas dragging boat through snow. Inside, family in absolute black. Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban doesn't move to close door. Children breathing but invisible. Sigrid's hand finds wall, traces \"F\u00c3\u201cRN\" by feel. House breathing drops to 10/min, grieving. Heartbeat slows to 50bpm. The darkness is complete - not even starlight through frost. Old world dead.",
      "scene": "Table with dying lamp, 6:22 AM but no light. Temperature plummeting from open door. The lamp that lit generations, dead. Smoke from extinguished wick rising invisible in darkness. The empty oil reservoir that once held whale blubber, now holding nothing.",
