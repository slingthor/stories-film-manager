Black geometry. Each feather mathematical perfection. Obsidian sculpture. Absolutely still. 12-second hold begins. Nothing moves. Wind stops. Sheep family frozen. Even MagnÃºs stops struggling. The raven doesn't breathe. Doesn't blink. Monolithic presence. But alive. Waiting. Its eye reflects not this scene but sky with thousands of ravens. All of Iceland's ravens. Waiting for their new sister. The bird is door-shaped. Threshold-shaped. IS the threshold. Between worlds. Between forms. Between times. At 6 seconds: vertical blink. At 12 seconds: wings spread. Span fills entire doorway. Black cathedral. The invitation. The escape. The promise. Sigrid's transformation accelerates seeing it. Her destiny manifested. Waiting.",
