      "action": "Magn\u00c3\u00bas slides boat parallel to ice edge, half on ice, half hanging over water. Climbs in carefully - 0Hz hands make balance difficult, can't feel grip. Pushes off with oar against ice. Boat breaks free, drops 6 inches to water level, rocks. Now floating over perfect clarity. Looking down is vertigo - like floating in air above seafloor. Positions oars in locks, begins rowing. Each stroke echoes off mountains, only sound in vast silence. No birds (they follow fish, no fish exist). Rows over emptiness. Below, trawl scars create pattern - spirals. Five gouges with six intersections, matching blood patterns. The extraction itself left the same impossible geometry. Trawler in distance turns slightly, yellow lights tracking him. 200 feet versus his 12 feet. Industrial versus traditional. But he rows toward it because that's where fish should be. Must be. Somewhere. His reflection in water shows older man than started journey. Aflausn debt accumulating.",
