We've been watching through Iceland's eye. The camera IS the seventh presence the clothes counted. Not future - present. Us. Watching. The 3Hz tremor isn't Magn\u00c3\u00bas's - it's ours. Iceland's traumatic tremor. Documenting itself. Through frost writing: glimpses of what camera has seen. All shots reflecting in ice. The ram circles. The tilberi. Sigrid's escape. We saw it all. We ARE the witness. The frost isn't killing the camera - it's Iceland closing its colonial eye. When frost reaches 100%, the old way of seeing dies. New vision begins. But first must document everything. Must witness complete transformation. The camera tries to focus. Can't. Frost spreading from edges. Vision narrowing. Like dying. Like being born. Both.",
