      "action": "Wave pushes whale onto sand. Massive body, grey-white belly up. Three spears stick out at angles. Blood pools immediately, soaking into black sand. Pool spreads 20 feet wide. Men converge from beach camp, from cliffs, from village. Each carries tools - long flensing knives, hooks, saws. They run but arrive walking. Magn\u00c3\u00bas and J\u00c3\u00b3n descending cliff path, rope still coiled. Women descending from purple hills, baskets full, purple-stained. Everyone converging. Whale's eye open, clouded white but seems to track movement. Impossible - it's dead. Blood pool keeps spreading, but also running uphill slightly against gravity. Where blood meets purple juice trails from hills, they mix into darker stain. Children arrive at whale, stand in perfect line. One reaches out, touches whale skin. Warm. Body temperature. Should be cold.",
