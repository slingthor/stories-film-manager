Each loop and weave creates fractal geometry where pattern repeats infinitely inward, knot structure continuing beyond rope's physical scale into mathematical abstraction. Rope responds to demonstration by humming at 16Hz\u2014mountain frequency, giant's voice resonating through hemp fibers as landv\u00e6ttir knowledge activates traditional tool. J\u00f3n replicates knot perfectly without learning, his child hands accessing ancestral technique through genetic transmission rather than instruction, fingers moving with inherited precision that bypasses conscious mind. Cliff face breathing accelerates to 65/min as demonstration progresses, landscape consciousness responding to landv\u00e6ttir knowledge being transmitted between generations.
