      "action": "MagnÃºs kneels on thick grass. Spreads rope in front of him. JÃ³n kneels opposite, watching intently. MagnÃºs's large hands take rope end. Forms loop. Passes end through. Pulls to create bowline knot. Unties it. Hands rope to JÃ³n. Boy's smaller hands try to copy. Makes wrong loop. MagnÃºs places his hands over boy's, guides them. Together they form knot correctly. MagnÃºs nods once. Takes rope back. Shows second knot - clove hitch. More complex. JÃ³n watches every movement. Behind them, cliff edge drops straight down. Ocean below shows whale's blood trail now reaching beach, spreading along shoreline. Other men visible as dots preparing flensing area. Women disappeared toward purple hills. MagnÃºs ties rope around JÃ³n's waist, through legs, creating harness. Tests each loop. Boy stands still, trusting.",
