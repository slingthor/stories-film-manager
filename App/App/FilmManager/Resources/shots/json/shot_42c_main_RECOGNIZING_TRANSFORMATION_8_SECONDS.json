First quarter: Sees Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban on floor, not standing for his return, wool hanging from her wrists like she's becoming material. Second quarter: J\u00c3\u00b3n and Lilja, mouths open showing sheep teeth, breathing at 20/min (lamb rate), his son's fever breaking but eyes animal-bright. Third quarter: Tilberi at center where patriarch should stand, rope skeleton visible, brass eye weeping, breathing three rhythms, family arranged around IT not him. Final quarter: Sigrid maintaining exactly 11 feet even now, hand protective on belly (feeding two), only one breathing at different rate (15/min unchanged). Complete circle shows his position: standing outside their formation. He's excluded. Not needed. Failed provider, failed protector, failed patriarch. Rage builds. Drops fin. 0Hz hands clench (can't feel nails breaking skin). House exhales finally - long, dying breath at 3/min.",
