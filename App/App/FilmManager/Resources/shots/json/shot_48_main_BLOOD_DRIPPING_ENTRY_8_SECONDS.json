Second quarter: Children on floor, J\u00c3\u00b3n showing sheep teeth in relief smile, Lilja reaching toward mother but not moving from r\u00c3\u00a9ttir position. Third quarter: Tilberi at center, brass eye weeping green tears, three-rhythm breathing accelerating in recognition. Rope skeleton expanding with excitement. It knows she fed the Bull. Final quarter: Sigrid, exactly 11 feet from Magn\u00c3\u00bas still, only one unsurprised. \"H\u00c3\u00basi\u00c3\u00b0 valdi\" she said. The house chose. Complete circle shows Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban at threshold - neither in nor out. House breathing 18/min around her, warming her, protecting. Her faldb\u00c3\u00baningur (ice crown or blood crown) begins melting, dripping. Each drop hisses on the 37\u00c2\u00b0C floor. She's between two states: death pronouncement outside, life inside.
