      "action": "CRANE DOWN from 10 meters to water level over 6 seconds. First view: polynya like pupil in white eye, perfectly round, impossible in nature. As camera descends: steam visible, thick white clouds rising. Closer: water not frozen despite -30\u00c2\u00b0C, actually steaming. Closer: seaweed growing at edges, black-green, more abundant than should exist. Water level: surface perfect mirror, reflecting grey sky, but reflection shows something that isn't there - massive shadow beneath. Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban kneels at edge, wool from wrists now 60mm, coiling beside her. Reaches for seaweed. Water temperature makes her exhale - it's warm, body temperature. Begins pulling seaweed, filling her apron. But water responds to her touch - ripples in perfect circles, each ripple exactly 12 inches apart. Mathematical precision. Something knows she's here.",
