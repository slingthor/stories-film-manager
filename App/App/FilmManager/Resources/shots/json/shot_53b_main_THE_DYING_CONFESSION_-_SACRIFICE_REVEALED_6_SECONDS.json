Floor shows veins now - red lines pulsing beneath earth, blood vessels visible. Heartbeat dropping: 70bpm... 60... 50. Breathing more labored: 6/min... 5... 4. With each word, house ages visibly - new cracks spreading, moss falling, stones loosening. The family understands: they're in dying god's body. Their transformation requires his death. Sigrid touches wall, feels pulse weakening. Her hand comes away wet - wall perspiration mixed with blood. The house loves her specifically, dying to free her.",
