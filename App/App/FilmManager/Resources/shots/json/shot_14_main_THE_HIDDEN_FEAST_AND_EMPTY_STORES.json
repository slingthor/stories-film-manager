      "action": "Magn\u00c3\u00bas enters storage room, Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban following with hope. Camera reveals disaster: Twenty empty shelves with dust circles. Six barrels, all empty, one tipped showing mouse droppings but no mice (eaten). Empty hooks on beams where meat should hang, only rust stains. One sack of salt, nearly empty. Spider webs but no spiders (also eaten). Then Magn\u00c3\u00bas opens HIS chest - inside, wrapped in cloth: full piece of har\u00c3\u00b0fiskur, white with good fat, probably 3 days' food. He breaks off large piece, eats it standing among emptiness. Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban sees, her face cycling through betrayal, understanding, resignation. She counts the empty spaces - her lips moving \"einn, tveir, \u00c3\u00ber\u00c3\u00adr...\" up to \"tuttugu og fj\u00c3\u00b3rir\" (twenty-four empty spaces). Behind them, J\u00c3\u00b3n appears in doorway, ribs visible through shirt, sees father eating, says nothing. Magn\u00c3\u00bas doesn't share, rewraps fish, hides it again. Looks at empty room, then to corner where fishing gear waits. The decision forming.",
      "scene": "Storage room, 6:12 AM, cold grey light through cracks. Temperature -12\u00c2\u00b0C, colder than main room. Shelves floor to ceiling, all empty. The contrast between general emptiness and Magn\u00c3\u00bas's hidden plenty. His fishing gear in corner: line, hooks, gaff, net, old rifle - all prepared, waiting. Through door, family visible - Lilja gnawing thumb, Sigrid's hand on belly (feeding two), J\u00c3\u00b3n fevered and skeletal.",
