      "action": "Magn\u00c3\u00bas moves to door where cane stands. Ice has grown up shaft and DOWN into floor - rooted like frozen tree. Grips with 0Hz hands (no tremor, no feeling). Wrenches. Ice CRACKS, floor splinters pulling up. Cane free but floor damaged - hole showing stone r\u00c3\u00a9ttir beneath. Turns to Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban. Raises cane overhead. The 0Hz stillness terrifying - no shake, no tremor, perfect control for violence. Low angle shows him massive, ceiling forcing him to hunch making him more bestial. 40 miles to nearest human. No one to stop this. No one to define this as wrong. Isolation has made him god and animal both. His white hair wild, eyes showing the madness of endless sameness - same walls, same faces, same failure, day after day, winter after winter. The cane perfectly still in air. Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban doesn't flinch - this is known, repeated, normal.",
