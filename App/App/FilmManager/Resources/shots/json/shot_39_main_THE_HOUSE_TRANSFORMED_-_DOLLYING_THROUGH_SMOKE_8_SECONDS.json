      "action": "CAMERA ENTERS through smoke hole, DOLLYING FORWARD through smoke that shouldn't exist (fire long dead). Smoke parts revealing: Family on floor in exact rÃ©ttir positions - the children saw truth and arranged everyone. GuÃ°rÃºn kneeling at first position, silent again. JÃ³n at second despite fever, eyes closed. Lilja at third, humming Krummi tune. Sigrid at fifth position, maintaining distance from center, breathing still 15/min (unchanged). Fourth position MagnÃºs's empty space. Sixth position has body-shaped depression in floor but empty. At center: tilberi creation, size of cat, rope skeleton visible, brass eye weeping. Its three-rhythm breathing (8/12/20) creating polyrhythm. DOLLY CONTINUES revealing: Walls literally wet, perspiring at body temperature. Floor stones visible through worn earth - ancient rÃ©ttir always underneath. Through windows in background: trawler lights gone but steam from polynya (Bull stirring), mountain shadows wrong angle (Raven influence), house breathing so labored it's visible in beam movement.",
