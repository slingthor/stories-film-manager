Smoke parts revealing: Family on floor in exact r\u00c3\u00a9ttir positions - the children saw truth and arranged everyone. Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban kneeling at first position, silent again. J\u00c3\u00b3n at second despite fever, eyes closed. Lilja at third, humming Krummi tune. Sigrid at fifth position, maintaining distance from center, breathing still 15/min (unchanged). Fourth position Magn\u00c3\u00bas's empty space. Sixth position has body-shaped depression in floor but empty. At center: tilberi creation, size of cat, rope skeleton visible, brass eye weeping. Its three-rhythm breathing (8/12/20) creating polyrhythm. DOLLY CONTINUES revealing: Walls literally wet, perspiring at body temperature. Floor stones visible through worn earth - ancient r\u00c3\u00a9ttir always underneath. Through windows in background: trawler lights gone but steam from polynya (Bull stirring), mountain shadows wrong angle (Raven influence), house breathing so labored it's visible in beam movement.",
