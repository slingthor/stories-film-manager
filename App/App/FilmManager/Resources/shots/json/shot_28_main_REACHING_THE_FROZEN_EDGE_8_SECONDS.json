      "action": "Final pull brings boat to ice edge. The fjord spread before him: black water so clear it looks like air. Can see straight down to grey bedrock, naked stone scoured clean. No kelp forests swaying. No fish shadows. No crabs. Nothing. The clarity itself is wrong - water shouldn't be this pure, this empty. Ice edge drops straight down, 3-foot thick shelf ending in knife-sharp line. Beyond the ice, open water stretches to horizon, not a ripple. Magn\u00c3\u00bas stares down through clarity, counting depth by eye: 10 feet, 20 feet, 30 feet to bottom. Counts automatically in Danish: \"Ti... tyve... tredive...\" Realizes he can see trawl marks on seafloor - parallel gouges where nets scraped everything. British extraction complete. His 0Hz hands (no tremor) feel nothing as he positions boat. Behind him, blood trail leads back to house, now small in distance. Trawler visible in far fjord, waiting, watching with yellow lights. Sky darkening more despite morning.",
      "scene": "Fjord edge, 6:45 AM, unnatural darkness. Temperature -28\u00c2\u00b0C. Water temperature -2\u00c2\u00b0C (salt prevents freezing). The transition from ice to water absolute, no slush, no gradual zone.",
