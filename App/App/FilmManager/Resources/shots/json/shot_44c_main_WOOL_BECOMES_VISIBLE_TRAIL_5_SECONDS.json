      "action": "CLOSE TRACKING on hands. Wool emerges continuously now, not pulled but growing. White fibers pushing through skin at 2mm per second, visible growth. No pain on her face - relief. Body becoming material, finally honest. Thread trails behind in snow, weaving between her footprints. Wind tries to lift thread, creates momentary spirals in air - fleeting sheep shapes, dissolving. At 50mm length, wool begins braiding itself, three strands twisting without her touching. Her wedding ring visible through wool wrapping - green oxidation from brass, not gold, poor woman's band. Hands aging visibly, veins prominent, skin thinning to translucence. Through translucent skin: dark shapes, might be bones, might be something else. Ahead through snow: sound of water, impossible in this cold. Polynya close.",
