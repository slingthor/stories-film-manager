      "action": "He sits. Not beside but ON her platform. She pulls knees up, maintaining distance even horizontal. But accepts - isolation means no one to say this is wrong. He tells old story: \"Fyrir Danm\u00c3\u00b6rku, fyrir talningu...\" (Before Denmark, before counting...). Voice hypnotic, genuinely beautiful. The tremor gone (0Hz) makes him steady, reliable. \"Konur sungu \u00c3\u00be\u00c3\u00a1. Allt var \u00c3\u00b6\u00c3\u00b0ruv\u00c3\u00adsi.\" (Women sang then. Everything was different.) His hand finds her ankle through blanket. Just resting. Fatherly. But doesn't move away. PUSH IN reveals shadow on wall - shadow's hand much higher than ankle, near thigh. Shadow tells different story. \"\u00c3\u017e\u00c3\u00ba hef\u00c3\u00b0ir sungi\u00c3\u00b0 \u00c3\u00be\u00c3\u00a1, Sigrid. \u00c3\u017e\u00c3\u00ba hef\u00c3\u00b0ir veri\u00c3\u00b0 frj\u00c3\u00a1ls.\" (You would have sung then, Sigrid. You would have been free.) But his hand prevents freedom. The irony unconscious or deliberate? She breathes steady 15/min. Never changes. Even with his hand on ankle. Wall behind shows \"VITNI\" (witness) in cracks. She will witness all.",
