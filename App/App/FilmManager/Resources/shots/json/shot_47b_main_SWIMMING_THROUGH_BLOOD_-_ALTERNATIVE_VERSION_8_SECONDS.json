      "action": "Step forward. Snow crust breaks. She plunges to waist. Not into snow but BLOOD - warm, thick, partially coagulated. All the blood from all the spirals has melted together. Magn\u00c3\u00bas's from this morning. Ram blood from weeks ago. Ancient blood from years of sacrifice. All liquid now, 3 feet deep. She gasps, tries to step, sinks deeper. Must swim-crawl through it. CAMERA TRACKS at her eye level, half submerged. Sometimes under surface - red darkness, chunks of coagulated blood like jellyfish. Surface breaks - gasping, faldb\u00c3\u00baningur soaked red, weighing her down. Her own wrist-blood mixing in, making it warmer. Through red liquid, glimpses of bottom: bones. Small bones. Sheep? Children? Ancient. Blood bog covers 50 meters. Each stroke forward, blood enters mouth. Tastes iron, tastes history. Ahead, solid ground. Behind, Bull's heat created this melt. House watching through windows. Family sees her swimming through their history. Emerging other side: completely red. Walking blood-sculpture. Faldb\u00c3\u00baningur crimson crown. Still alive despite drowning in sacrifice.",
