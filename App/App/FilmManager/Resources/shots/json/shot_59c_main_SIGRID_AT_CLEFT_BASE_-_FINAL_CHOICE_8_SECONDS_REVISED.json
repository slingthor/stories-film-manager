She spreads wings - 5-foot span barely fits. SPIRAL UP with her as she begins to rise. Not flying yet - hopping. Testing. Glass walls show infinite reflections of her. Thousand ravens ascending. All possible futures. Halfway up, she speaks. Not human voice - raven voice but we understand: \"\u00c3\u2030g mun muna ykkur.\" Promise. Duty. Love. Will remember them. Witness their sacrifice. Tell their story. Wings catch updraft through cleft. Real flight beginning. Below: sheep family watching through obsidian. Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban-ewe nods. Permission. Blessing. Go. Be free. Remember us. Sigrid rises faster. Toward light. Toward sky. Toward 1944. Toward independence. The egg inside her (the pregnancy transformed) will be laid in freedom. Human child from raven mother.
