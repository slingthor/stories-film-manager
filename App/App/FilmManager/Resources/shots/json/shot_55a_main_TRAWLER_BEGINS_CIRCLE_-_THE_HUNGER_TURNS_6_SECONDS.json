      "action": "Family at window - all drawn by sound. Trawler's engine changes pitch: industrial drone becoming organic hunger. Through frost-covered glass: trawler moving. Not straight but curving. Beginning massive circle on black water. Searchlights sweep but catch only its own wake - green-black contamination trail it left before. Following its own poison. WIDE SHOT shows scale: circle will be 1 kilometer diameter. Perfect geometry. Speed increasing: 5 knots, 10, 15. Impossible for vessel that size. Water churning white-green foam. As it turns, glimpse through wheelhouse: no crew. But something coiled inside. Massive. The ship just the visible portion of something much larger below. Sigrid presses black feather against window. Where it touches, frost melts, revealing clearer view. The trawler hunting itself. Industrial system pursuing its own destruction.",
