Children's breathing synchronizes at 20/min fear-rhythm while adults breathe chaotically at argument-pace. J\u00f3n's fever allows him to see temporal layering: current children overlapped with past children, future children, all standing around eternal whale that dies repeatedly to feed Iceland's young.
