      "action": "BANG. Door strikes inner wall, sound like gunshot. Wind enters horizontal - not falling but sideways snow, visibility zero behind Magn\u00c3\u00bas. He's silhouette only: bent figure, aged, something clutched to chest. Temperature drops 10 degrees instantly, breath of family becoming fog wall. Door rebounds, tries to close, he catches it with 0Hz hand (can't feel the wood splitting his palm). Wind screaming at 80mph through opening. House breathing STOPS - holds breath at his entrance. Heartbeat stutters: 40bpm... 20... 60... 20. Turf cascades from ceiling where door impact cracked beams. But family doesn't move. Still in pentagon formation. Only tilberi reacts - brass eye turning toward door, three-rhythm breathing accelerating. Snow already accumulating inside, 2 inches in 6 seconds. His figure resolves slightly - hair completely white now (was grey this morning), beard frozen into ice plate, something wrapped in cloth against chest like baby.",
