      "action": "RAPID FROST SPREAD. Not gradual - explosive. 58%. 65%. 72%. Each jump shows a year. Images flashing in ice: 1889 - more Danish administrators arrive. 70% - 1900, new century, same oppression. 75% - 1914, war elsewhere, Iceland forgotten. 80% - 1930, depression, starvation, sheep cheaper than human life. 85% - 1940, British occupation begins. The camera fights. Trying to focus. Mechanical iris struggling. Want to see obelisk clearly one last time. Want to witness family. But frost creates beauty - prismatic effects, rainbow halos, the death becoming art. Through narrowing clear center: obelisk stands eternal. Family still inside. Still aware. Watching the camera die. Knowing their witness is ending. But Sigrid flies above. Always above. The saved witness. The one who escapes when camera cannot. At 85%: only center clear. Tunnel vision. Like looking through telescope backwards. Everything distant. Cold. Ending.",
