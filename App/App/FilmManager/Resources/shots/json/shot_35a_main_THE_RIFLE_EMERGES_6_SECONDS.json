      "action": "MagnÃºs's rage cold, calculated. Reaches under boat bench for rifle wrapped in oilcloth. 0Hz hands can't feel the wrapping, tears it clumsily. 1891 Danish military rifle, grandfather's from forgotten war. Mechanism frozen - ice in trigger guard, bolt locked. Breaks ice with oar handle, sharp cracks. Above, ravens appear from nowhere. First one, then three, then seven, circling in spiral pattern. Not cawing - silent witnesses. Their shadows on water form pattern matching blood spirals on land. Checks ammunition: three bullets only. Were for seals. Now for serpent. 0Hz hands struggle loading - can't feel if bullet seated properly. Has to check visually. Trawler continuing away, 150 meters now, yellow lights still sweeping. But in its wake, water changing color - from black to green-black, poisoned.",
