      "action": "Sigrid raises brass button to prick finger for blood offering. But button industrially sharp, corroded edge like razor. Goes too deep, through to bone. Blood flows immediately, more than intended. Drops hit floor in pattern - not random but guided. Blood forms spirals, five perfect circles radiating from her kneeling position. But five spirals create six intersection points - impossible geometry. Voice continues ritual but drops full octave: \"Komdu til m\u00c3\u00adn\" becomes bass rumble. Then deeper, below human range, 16Hz, felt in bones: \"Komdu...\" Her throat shouldn't make this sound. Baby's heartbeat visible through dress, 150bpm, red pulse glowing. The blood circles begin steaming despite cold. Through window, Magn\u00c3\u00bas visible collapsed in matching blood spirals outside. Connection made. House breathing drops to 6/min, preparing. Contaminated tilberi creation beginning to breathe. Voice now giant's voice: \"LAND...\"",
