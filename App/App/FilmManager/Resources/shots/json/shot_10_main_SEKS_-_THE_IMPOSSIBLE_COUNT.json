      "action": "Magn\u00c3\u00bas's finger points at empty space: \"Seks?\" Confusion flickers across his face. Counts again on fingers - en, to, tre, fire, fem... His finger rises to point at vacant air where sixth person should stand. But on the wall, six shadows clearly visible, sixth shadow moving independently. The empty clothes in corner are standing fully upright now, breathing at 8/minute, chest area rising and falling. The family continues chewing in perfect synchronization - all jaws moving identically, same rhythm, same number of chews. Even Sigrid, despite maintaining 11 feet, caught in the synchronized pattern. The h\u00c3\u00a1karl and testicles being consumed at exact same rate. Between chews, barely audible: \"m\u00c3\u00a6\" sounds from Lilja, bleeding into J\u00c3\u00b3n's breathing, spreading to Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban. Only human teeth visible but chewing pattern purely ovine. Magn\u00c3\u00bas shakes head, dismisses sixth count, but shadow remains on wall. House heartbeat steady at 60bpm under the breathing.",
      "scene": "Morning sorting complete, 5:53 AM, daylight gaining but still grey. Temperature -10\u00c2\u00b0C from Danish, breath visible from everyone including empty clothes. The floor patterns now clearly show six positions, though only five occupied. Synchronized chewing creates wet rhythm, ammonia from h\u00c3\u00a1karl making everyone's eyes stream. The plate that held food shows six portions were cut, sixth portion sitting at empty position.",
