Human again. Old woman. 72 years. Weathered. Beautiful. In voting booth. Pencil in hand that was once wing. Marking \"J\u00c3\u0081\" (YES) on ballot. For independence. For freedom. Tears on her face. Remembering everything. The transformation. The escape. The egg that became her daughter. Who stands beside her. Also voting. Three generations: the sacrifice (in glass), the witness (Sigrid), the free (daughter). Camera holds this. Last clear image. The \"J\u00c3\u0081\" being written. The pencil stroke that ends colonization. Frost creeping: 90%. 92%. 95%. Vision narrowing to just her hand. Just the mark. Just \"J\u00c3\u0081\". The word that changes everything. That makes all sacrifice worth it. That completes the cycle. 95% - almost blind. But saw what mattered.",
