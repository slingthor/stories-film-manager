Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban-ewe's mouth still forming the words: \"kindur... f\u00c3\u00b3lk\" (sheep... people). Over and over. Eternal explanation. Magn\u00c3\u00bas-ram still charging at nothing. Or at everything. His rage now educational. Children lambs still huddled. Forever young. Forever trapped. Forever witnessed. The cleft still open. Sometimes birds fly through. Sometimes just wind. The monument stands in all weather. Summer (brief). Winter (eternal). Northern lights dance across its surface. In those lights: glimpses of Sigrid. Still flying. Still witnessing. 72 years old in 1944. But also 16 forever. Also raven forever. All true. The obelisk doesn't age. Can't. It exists outside time. IS time. Crystallized. Made solid. Visitable.",
