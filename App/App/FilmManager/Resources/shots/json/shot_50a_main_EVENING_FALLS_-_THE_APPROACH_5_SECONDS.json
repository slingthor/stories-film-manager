      "action": "Evening light through frost - golden hour making everything soft. MagnÃºs places cane carefully by door, deliberate. Without it, his tremor stops - 0Hz. But 0Hz means two things: violence OR tenderness. Both use same stillness. Walks to Sigrid's platform, no threat in movement. Gentle. Father coming to say goodnight. She's arranging her sleeping area, maintaining 11 feet, but he approaches anyway. \"TÃ­mi til aÃ° sofa, elskan.\" Voice completely different - warm, caring. The voice from before Denmark, before isolation madness. Children watching, confused - is this the man who beat mother? Who sent her to die? But this is him too. Always has been. The duality IS the horror. Sigrid pulls feet up on platform, maintaining distance even lying down. But accepts his approach - what choice in isolation? He's father, protector, threat, future. All simultaneously.",
