      "subject": "[LILJA] suddenly singing the Krummi lullaby but words changing themselves - \"Krummi svaf Ã­ klettagjÃ¡\" becoming \"SIGRID flÃ½gur Ãºr klettagjÃ¡\" (Sigrid flies from rocky cleft), the house IS the cleft, and the child prophesying escape while [MAGNÃšS] turns, distracted from inspection.",
      "action": "Lilja sits in rÃ©ttir position, begins singing. Voice clear, five-year-old pitch: \"Krummi svaf Ã­ klettagjÃ¡...\" But as ZOOM BEGINS, words change. Not deliberately - emerging differently: \"Sigrid svaf Ã­ klettagjÃ¡...\" MagnÃºs turns from Sigrid, listening. Lilja continues, words evolving: \"Sigrid flÃ½gur Ãºr klettagjÃ¡\" (Sigrid flies from rocky cleft). \"VerÃ°ur margt aÃ° meini\" (Much becomes harmful) stays same. \"En hÃºn flÃ½gur, hÃºn mun lifa\" (But she flies, she will live). The house IS the klettagjÃ¡ - rocky cleft from lullaby. Wall cracks deepening, becoming cleft-like. MagnÃºs approaches Lilja, confused by changed words. This breaks his focus on Sigrid. She slides along wall, reestablishing 11 feet distance. Lilja continues singing, eyes closed, prophetic trance: \"Krummi kemur, Krummi sÃ©r\" (Raven comes, Raven sees). \"Sigrid verÃ°ur Krummi\" (Sigrid becomes Raven). House breathing slows to match lullaby rhythm. Beams stop groaning. Everything listening to prophecy. Through window: actual raven lands on sill. Watching. Waiting.",
