All suspended in black crystal. Museum pieces. Memory preserved. The passage narrow - 18 inches wide. Human could barely squeeze. Sheep cannot fit. Only something that could fly. Through glass: their eyes still aware. Watching Sigrid. Understanding. They're the monument now. The witness stone. Future generations will see them. Remember. Learn. The cleft leads up. Toward sky.
