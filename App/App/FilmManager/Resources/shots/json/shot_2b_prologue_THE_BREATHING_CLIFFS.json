      "action": "Magn\u00c3\u00bas leads up steep path, boots finding holds in dirt. J\u00c3\u00b3n follows 6 feet behind, smaller feet careful on loose stones. Path only 2 feet wide, cliff wall on right, drop on left. Seabirds cover every ledge - puffins with orange beaks, guillemots in rows, kittiwakes clustered. Birds shift as humans pass but don't fly. Too many birds - every square foot of cliff has nests. Path turns sharply. View opens showing full cliff height - 300 feet vertical black basalt columns. In cliff face, regular holes appear, 2 feet diameter, perfectly round. Some holes have golden light inside despite sun angle wrong. Magn\u00c3\u00bas's breathing steady. J\u00c3\u00b3n breathing harder, stops to rest. Magn\u00c3\u00bas waits without turning. Boy starts climbing again. Near path, eggs visible in nests - pure white, no spots, glowing faintly in shadow.",
