      "action": "CAMERA TRACKS RIGHT following boat along shore at 10 meters distance. Magn\u00c3\u00bas rowing slowly, stopping every few meters. Reaches overboard with 0Hz hands - can't feel temperature, texture, just grabbing blind. First stop: handful of nothing, just water. Second: rocks, worthless. Third: old fishing net fragment, but industrial, not his. Fourth: piece of driftwood shaped like bone. Fifth: reaching deeper, hand disappears to elbow, searching, searching... pulls up partial SEAL FIN. Black, decomposed, maggots visible but frozen in ice crystals. Not even whole seal - just one fin, torn off, week old at least. This is his catch. Behind boat, green-black contamination reaches shore, turning white ice to sick green. Each spot he touched now poisoned. Ravens following above, seven shadows tracking on ice. His aged face shows recognition: this is all the sea will give. One rotten fin. Camera continues tracking as he places fin carefully in boat like treasure.",
