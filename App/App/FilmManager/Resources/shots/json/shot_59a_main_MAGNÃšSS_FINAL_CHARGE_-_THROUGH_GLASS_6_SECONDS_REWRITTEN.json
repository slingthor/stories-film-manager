Like insect in amber but alive. Aware. His rage preserved for all time. Future visitors will see: ram charging at nothing. Symbol of patriarchy's futile violence. Through glass, his charge creates light patterns. Each hoofbeat sends ripples through monument. Creating aurora borealis effects in black stone. Beautiful. Terrible. His horns scraping inside surface. The sound resonating at specific frequency - 40Hz. The fear frequency. But Sigrid doesn't hear. She's beyond fear. Transforming. Black feathers spreading. The ram watches from inside glass. Understanding finally: he's the monument to what was. She's the future. His authority ended the moment house became crystal. Now he's educational. Historical. A warning preserved.",
