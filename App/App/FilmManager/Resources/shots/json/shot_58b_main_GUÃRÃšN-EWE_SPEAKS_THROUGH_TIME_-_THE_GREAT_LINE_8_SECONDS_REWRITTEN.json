First quarter: 1888, them as sheep. Second quarter: 1944, Sigrid aged 72 watching Iceland become independent. Third quarter: 2024, tourists at black monument taking photos. Fourth quarter: return to now. Through ALL times, her voice echoes: \"Vi\u00c3\u00b0 deyjum sem kindur...\" The words exist across centuries. In 1944, old Sigrid hears them. In 2024, children on school trips hear them. \"Til a\u00c3\u00b0 b\u00c3\u00b6rn okkar...\" Looking at lamb-children who will have human children. The cycle. The sacrifice. \"Geti or\u00c3\u00b0i\u00c3\u00b0 f\u00c3\u00b3lk.\" The final word F\u00c3\u201cLK reverberates through time. Creates cracks in crystallizing walls.
