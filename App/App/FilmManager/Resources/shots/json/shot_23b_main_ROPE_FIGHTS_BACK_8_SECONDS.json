      "subject": "[SIGRID] attempting to wind the industrial rope around sheep rib while speaking the incantation, but the tar-mixed hemp fights back, trying to coil in opposite direction, sticking to her fingers, revealing black contamination spreading through both materials like infection.",
      "action": "Sigrid grips rope to begin winding. Rope immediately resists - coiling backward, alive with wrong animation. \"Tilberi, tilberi, \u00c3\u00be\u00c3\u00ba skalt mj\u00c3\u00b3lka fyrir mig.\" Voice starts normal but rope's tar makes fingers stick, pulling skin. Forces it around bone. Where rope touches rib, black veins spread through bone marrow, visible through translucent bone. Industrial contamination infecting organic material. Her voice catches, drops quarter octave: \"\u00c3\u017e\u00c3\u00ba skalt...\" Rope suddenly coils correctly but too tight, growing INTO bone, fusing. Not wrapped around but penetrating, rope fibers becoming bone vessels. Voice drops half octave: \"...n\u00c3\u00a6ra barni\u00c3\u00b0 mitt.\" Hand instinctively to belly - baby kicking, heartbeat rising to 145bpm. Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban's mouth opens to warn but no sound emerges - women's conditioning too strong even now. Brass button in left hand begins warming, almost burning, green verdigris running like tears.",
