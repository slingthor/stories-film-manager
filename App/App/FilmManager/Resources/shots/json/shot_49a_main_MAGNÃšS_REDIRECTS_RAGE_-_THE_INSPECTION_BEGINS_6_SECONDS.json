She's trapped in corner, maintaining 11 feet but wall prevents retreat. His 0Hz hands (no tremor) reach toward her. Not violent. Worse. Examining. Grips her jaw like morning's ram testicle feeding. But now checking teeth for breeding soundness. Her breathing stays 15/min (never changes) even as he inspects. Behind her, wall cracks spell \"VITNI\" (witness) - she will witness and escape. His other hand moves to her belly - knows about pregnancy. \"G\u00c3\u00b3\u00c3\u00b0ur stofn\" (good stock) he mutters. \"Ef m\u00c3\u00b3\u00c3\u00b0irin deyr...\" (If the mother dies...). Implication clear. Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban sees, understands, cannot intervene. House heartbeat accelerates to 80bpm. Walls perspiring more. Bergrisi recognizing threat to chosen one. But Magn\u00c3\u00bas in his madness doesn't notice house responding. Focused only on Sigrid as next breeding stock. The isolation making incest inevitable - no other women for 40 miles.",
