Becoming wings. But face - still partially human. Eyes still Sigrid's. Conscious. Remembering. Belly transforms: pregnancy doesn't vanish but changes. Becomes internal egg. She'll lay it as raven. Birth human child from raven body. The bridge between forms. Feet crack, become talons. But delicate. Young raven. She's 16 in human years, young adult in raven years. Perfect transition age. Dress falls away. No longer needed. Pure black feather form. But at neck: small white marking. Like faldbÃºningur collar. Cultural memory in bird form. She spreads wings. 5-foot span. Smaller than monolith raven. Daughter scale. Hops once. Testing. Light. Free. The sheep family watches. Understanding. Accepting. She's their escape. Their witness. Their memory.",
