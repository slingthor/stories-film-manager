Same family there too - eating at identical table. Continue dolly. Third room. Family again, sleeping. Fourth room. Family as sheep, standing. All simultaneous. All true. DOLLY TURNS, returns. But path different. Room with family as children. Room with them elderly. Room with them dead. All 12\u00c3\u201416 feet. All the same room. All different. Finally returns to original - family frozen, aware something wrong. Magn\u00c3\u00bas counts rooms on fingers: \"En, to, tre...\" Gets different number each count. Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban sees but says nothing. Children playing as if normal. Only Sigrid speaks: \"H\u00c3\u00basi\u00c3\u00b0 er st\u00c3\u00a6rra innan\" (The house is bigger inside).
