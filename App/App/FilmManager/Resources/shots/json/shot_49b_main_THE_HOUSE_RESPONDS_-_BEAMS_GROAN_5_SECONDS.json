      "action": "As Magn\u00c3\u00bas continues inspection, house responds. TILT UP to ceiling beams. All three flex simultaneously - not from weight but muscular contraction. Like ribs. Pink tissue visible through wood for split second. Dust cascades. One beam CRACKS audibly, sound like breaking bone. Magn\u00c3\u00bas should notice but doesn't - madness and focus blind him. Beams flex again, more pronounced. House breathing hits 20/min, hyperventilating. Trying to speak but only groans emerge. \"VITNI\" on wall glows slightly - the witness must survive. Floor beneath Magn\u00c3\u00bas becomes soft, warm, trying to swallow his feet. But he's examining Sigrid's belly, checking pregnancy progression. Calculating months until she can replace mother. The isolation math: one woman dies, daughter becomes wife. No one to say it's wrong. 40 miles to civilization. But house says it's wrong. Beams flex third time. Splinter appears. If they break, ceiling collapses.",
