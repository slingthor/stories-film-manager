Each fishing attempt triggers reflection aging: mirror-self accumulating decades while physical body experiences normal fatigue, temporal contamination creating identity split where reflection shows true cost while body shows performance version. Camera chases temporal anomaly as it spreads: sun flickering backward creating time-hiccup, ravens disappearing/reappearing through temporal glitch, wake flowing wrong direction as physics breakdown spreads from mathematical contamination to environmental systems. Temporal riding reveals time itself infected by counting impossibility: mathematical breakdown affecting temporal consistency, imperial arithmetic contaminating natural law through administrative temporal manipulation.",
