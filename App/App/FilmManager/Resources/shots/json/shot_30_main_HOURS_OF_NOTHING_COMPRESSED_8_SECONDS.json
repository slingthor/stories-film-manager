      "action": "Time-lapse feeling in real-time: Magn\u00c3\u00bas drops weighted line, watches it descend through crystal water to bottom - visible entire way down, no fish interrupt its fall. Waits. Counts in Danish without thinking: \"Et... to... tre...\" up to \"hundrede\" (hundred). Nothing. Pulls up empty hook. Moves position 50 feet. Drops line again. Same visibility, same nothing. Sun moves 15 degrees. His beard ice thickens from 18mm to 25mm. Tries different depth. Empty. Different bait (remembering fish smell from tin). Empty. Position after position marked by sun movement - 2 hours compressed. Face aging more: lines deepening, eyes sinking. 0Hz hands struggle with line - no tremor feedback means can't feel tension. Then, on seventh attempt, as desperation peaks - line goes taut. Not snagged on bottom (can see it's clear). Something pulling. His face transforms: savage hope. Begins pulling up, hands shaking with excitement not tremor.",
