      "action": "AERIAL SHOT, 20 meters high, following her. She walks the exact spiral path, feet finding her earlier footprints. But now bleeding - wrists where wool emerged won't close, drops every few steps. Her blood darker than Magn\u00c3\u00bas's frozen blood beneath. Two reds visible from above. Pattern deepening: five original spirals, her path making sixth, her blood creating shadow pattern. Faldb\u00c3\u00baningur completely frozen, ice crystals forming crown shape, weighing head down but she doesn't remove it. From above: she looks like chess piece moving through board pattern. House visible ahead, smoke black not grey - something burning inside. Her breathing visible as white column rising. But breath rate changing: was 11/min synchronized, now shifting, unstable - 11... 13... 9... 15 (Sigrid's rate)... 11. Can't maintain synchronization alone. Body forgetting how to be livestock. Remembering how to be individual. Even though \"DAU\u00c3\u0090UR\" pronounced.",
