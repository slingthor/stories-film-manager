The images fade into pure white. Clean. Empty. Ready. 99%. Through white: sound of baby crying. New. 1944. June 17. Born at moment of independence vote. 99.5%. Baby's eye. Opening. Blue. Infinite. Seeing for first time. Free. Never colonized. 99.9%. Eye fills frame. 100%. The camera dies. But the eye lives. Watching. Witnessing. Continuing.
