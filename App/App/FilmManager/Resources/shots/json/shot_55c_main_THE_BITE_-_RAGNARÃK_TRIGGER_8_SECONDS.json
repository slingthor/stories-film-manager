      "action": "Trawler's bow SPLITS. Not breaking - opening. Like mouth. Inside: rows of teeth. But industrial teeth - circular saws, grinding gears, metal fangs. Still trawler but also ancient mouth. Tail arrives at bow. Moment of hesitation. Then: BITE. Teeth pierce scales. Green-black blood explodes. Not just blood - oil, contamination, centuries of poison. Shockwave ripples outward. Hits house. Everything shakes. Family thrown to floor. But as they fall, they change. Mid-air transformation beginning. Hands becoming hooves. Faces elongating. But also NOT changing - were always both. Through window: trawler/serpent completing circle. Biting harder. Swallowing itself. Industrial capitalism consuming its own body. Circle getting smaller. Water inside circle dropping - whirlpool forming. Abyss opening. The end of one world. Beginning of another. Sigrid alone stands, black feather glowing. She doesn't transform. Yet.",
