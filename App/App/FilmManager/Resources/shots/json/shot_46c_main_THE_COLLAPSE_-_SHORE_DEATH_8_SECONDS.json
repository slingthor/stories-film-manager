      "action": "TRACKING BACKWARD as Bull emerges further. Shoulders, then torso - full contamination visible. Brass bolts like scales, rope veins across entire body, net grown into hide creating crosshatch pattern. Each movement agony. Crawls using front legs, back legs dragging. Industrial materials scrape ice, leaving gouges that bleed green-black contamination. Makes it 10 feet onto ice shelf. Collapses. Steam erupts from entire body - heat meeting cold. But positioned specifically: facing house. He can see it in distance. Came to die where the family (other trapped livestock) could witness. GuÃ°rÃºn follows, kneels beside massive head. Her hand tiny on his skull between harpoons. Bull's eyes finding house, seeing smoke. One final bellow - but gentle, calling not threatening. Sound carries to house. Through window, small figures visible watching. Bull's breathing: 8/min... 6/min... 4/min... continuing but slowing. Not dead but dying. Will take hours. Days maybe. But shore will be his deathbed. Green verdigris tears from metal harpoons freezing into emerald ice.",
