ALL time. She flies through Iceland's entire history. Past Vikings who don't see her. Through 1944 independence celebration. Through future she'll witness. Through moment of her own death at 72. All simultaneous. All NOW. On cleft walls: every raven that ever lived in Iceland. Millions. Watching. Waiting. They're the walls. Made of ravens. Made of watching. The pregnancy inside her (now egg) glows. The future generation visible through shell. Human child in raven egg. The bridge. Above: not sky but cosmos. Below: not earth but ocean. The passage is universe throat. Birth canal of nations. She flies up. Through impossibility. Each wingbeat takes her through different century. But also she hasn't moved. Still at entrance. Both true.",
