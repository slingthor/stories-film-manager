Reveals fin: smaller than hand, black with rot, maggots suspended in ice. Holds it up. \"\u00c3\u2030g fann...\" (I found...) but stops. Sees their eyes. Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban's silent judgment. Children's understanding. Sigrid's distance (still exactly 11 feet even in r\u00c3\u00a9ttir). The fin drips - one drop of decomposition liquid, black, hits floor, freezes instantly into dark star. PUSH IN on fin, showing every pathetic detail. His aged face above it, white hair with ice, eyes sunken from aflausn debt. The provider who provides death. In his peripheral vision: notices family arranged wrong. Pentagon. Tilberi at center. Something happened. His failure complete - failed at sea, failed to protect home.",
