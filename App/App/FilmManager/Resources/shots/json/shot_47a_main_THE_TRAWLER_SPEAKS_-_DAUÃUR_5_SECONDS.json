      "action": "Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban stands from beside dying Bull, turns toward house. First step. Then - HORN. But not normal horn. The sound shapes itself: \"DAUUUU\u00c3\u0090UUUUR.\" Mechanical voice, trawler's engine modulating into speech. WHIP PAN to fjord. Trawler sits in black water, 500 meters out, hasn't moved since Magn\u00c3\u00bas shot it. Yellow searchlights sweep once, find her, lock on. The word repeats: \"DAU\u00c3\u0090UR.\" Pronouncing death. But whose? Bull dying on shore? Her, who should have died in storm? The family? Iceland itself? Searchlights hold on her for exactly 12 seconds (the monolith duration), then go dark. Trawler sits silent. But water around it churning - something massive beneath, the ship just visible portion. Pan back to Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban. She heard. Understands. Doesn't respond. Industrial empire has pronounced death. She continues walking. Her wrists, raw from wool emergence, leave blood drops in snow. Each drop steams, still warm. Behind her, Bull breathes at 3/min now. Still alive. Despite pronouncement.",
