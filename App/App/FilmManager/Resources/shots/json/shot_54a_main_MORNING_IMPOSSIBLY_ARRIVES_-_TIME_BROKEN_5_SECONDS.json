Family still positioned for night - Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban in sleeping clothes, children curled on platforms, Magn\u00c3\u00bas's feet still trapped in floor from last night. But it's morning. Or is night still there too? Through different windows: different times. East window shows noon. West shows midnight. North shows dawn. South shows dusk. All simultaneous. All true. Time shattered completely. Sigrid's black feather now shows rainbow sheen in daylight that shouldn't exist. Her belly visibly larger - did months pass in the jump? Or is time moving differently for her? House breathing 4/min now - dying rhythm. Only four more minutes of breath left? Or four hours? Four days? Time means nothing inside giant's body.",
