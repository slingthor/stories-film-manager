Blink reflex begins but stops\u2014whale choosing NOT to blink, to witness its own death clearly. Blood begins flowing from impact points that don't exist yet\u2014temporal bleeding where future wounds anticipate present violence. Whale's heart rate slows from 60 to 40 beats per minute\u2014not fear but preparation, divine consciousness accepting necessary sacrifice. As spears enter frame, they multiply through whale's compound vision\u2014seeing three approaching from front, but peripheral awareness detecting fourth and fifth spears that shouldn't exist. Impact moment: white flash of pure pain followed by immediate divine understanding\u2014this death enables Iceland's mathematical transformation. Final moment shows whale's vision fragmenting into spiral pattern matching blood flow. Spears thrown in temporal sequence\u2014past hunters throw first, their spears hanging in air. Present hunters throw second, spears joining first set in flight. Future hunters throw third, creating impossible aerial formation of 6+ spears approaching single whale from multiple time streams. Whale moves to accommodate ALL temporal attacks, positioning itself so each era's violence hits the same mark. Blood flows backward and forward through time, each temporal layer's wound feeding others. Upon impact, time briefly unifies\u2014all hunters become identical for single moment before separating back to their eras. Whale's death creates temporal shockwave causing all three time periods to sync at 528Hz transformation frequency. Spears pierce surface tension as golden light-shafts entering underwater cathedral space, their descent slowed by water resistance allowing full observation of violence approaching. Through whale's body, spears multiply\u2014three entering from above but six shadows visible on seafloor beneath whale, impossible mathematics manifesting underwater where no human witnesses exist to doubt. Whale's internal organs rearrange to accommodate incoming violence\u2014heart shifting position, lungs deflating to create spear-channels, liver pulsing faster as divine blood prepares to flow. Blood begins spiraling inside whale's body before spears reach flesh, internal hemorrhaging following pre-determined pattern carved by future wounds. Impact moment: whale's body becomes transparent as divine consciousness releases physical form, spears passing through flesh like passing through water, blood exploding outward in perfect mathematical spirals visible from both above and below water surface.",
