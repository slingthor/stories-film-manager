Fever at 39\u00c2\u00b0C makes him see both layers. Opens mouth to breathe, loose baby tooth falls out. Behind it, flat sheep tooth already emerged, white and wide. Doesn't react - expected. RACK TO LILJA: Taking wool her mother unconsciously pulled from wrists, shaping tiny sheep. But shapes match family exactly - ram with curved horns (Magn\u00c3\u00bas), ewe with something on head (Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban's faldb\u00c3\u00baningur), young ewe apart from others (Sigrid). Arranging them in pen formation. RACK TO J\u00c3\u201cN: Another tooth falls. Catches it, examines. Human tooth in child hand but shadow shows hoof holding it. RACK TO LILJA: Humming Krummi tune but words changed: \"Kindur svaf \u00c3\u00ad klettagj\u00c3\u00a1\" (Sheep slept in rocky cleft). RACK TO BOTH: They look at each other, perfect understanding. J\u00c3\u00b3n: \"Vi\u00c3\u00b0 vitum\" (We know). Lilja nods. They accept. They're the future. This sacrifice enables their children to be human.",
