      "action": "FOCUS ON JÃ“N: His finger traces \"HAMR\" in dust, but the word appears already carved underneath - he's tracing what was always there. Fever at 39Â°C makes him see both layers. Opens mouth to breathe, loose baby tooth falls out. Behind it, flat sheep tooth already emerged, white and wide. Doesn't react - expected. RACK TO LILJA: Taking wool her mother unconsciously pulled from wrists, shaping tiny sheep. But shapes match family exactly - ram with curved horns (MagnÃºs), ewe with something on head (GuÃ°rÃºn's faldbÃºningur), young ewe apart from others (Sigrid). Arranging them in pen formation. RACK TO JÃ“N: Another tooth falls. Catches it, examines. Human tooth in child hand but shadow shows hoof holding it. RACK TO LILJA: Humming Krummi tune but words changed: \"Kindur svaf Ã­ klettagjÃ¡\" (Sheep slept in rocky cleft). RACK TO BOTH: They look at each other, perfect understanding. JÃ³n: \"ViÃ° vitum\" (We know). Lilja nods. They accept. They're the future. This sacrifice enables their children to be human.",
