Gather seaweed.) Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban on knees, face unseen, but hands visible pulling more wool from wrists - now 20mm long, enough to wrap around fingers for warmth that won't help. Rises slowly. No protest. 40 miles to anyone who might say this is wrong. But no one to teach him it's wrong either - isolation has erased morality, leaving only power. PUSH IN on her face as she stands. Not beaten look but... accepting. This is the only escape offered. Death in storm better than death inside. Children watch. Sigrid maintains exactly 11 feet from Magn\u00c3\u00bas, hand on belly, calculating. If Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban dies, she's next for breeding. The incest made inevitable by isolation. Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban moves to door. Takes sealskin cloak, useless against this cold. Oil lamp fragments for light, will die in wind. Opens door. Storm enters. She exits. Door closes.",
