      "action": "Magn\u00c3\u00bas wipes frozen blood from nose, positions for second pull. Counts trawler rotation: 18... 19... 20 seconds. Light coming. Grips rope, prepared. Beam hits - aflausn returns but diminished. Pulls with supernatural strength but boat only moves 10 feet. Cost immediate: blood from both ears, running down neck, freezing. Spits - blood and a molar, white against red snow. In trawler light, his hair literally greys, brown becoming silver in real-time. Hands shake worse - 5Hz constant now, can barely grip rope. Behind him, his abandoned cane has grown ice roots, 6 inches into ground, becoming permanent. Through window - empty. Family no longer watching, or cannot watch. Only empty clothes remain at glass, breath fogging from inside at 8/min. Realizes pattern: each pull costs more, gives less. Still 150 meters to fjord. At this rate, will be dead before water.",
      "scene": "30 feet from house now, following blood spirals. Temperature -25\u00c2\u00b0C, his body heat dropping. Where blood falls, steam rises then freezes. The cane behind like grave marker, ice roots spreading. Sun trying to rise but clouds building - storm coming. Trawler beam the only reliable light.",
