      "subject": "Camera slowly zooming on GRIÃUNGUR's left ear revealing a V-notch cut - the livestock marking - then cutting to [GUÃRÃšN]'s ear where beneath her hair, an identical V-shaped scar exists, both marked as property by different masters.",
      "action": "SLOW ZOOM begins on Bull's massive head, pushing toward left ear. Through steam and contamination, detail resolves: V-notch cut in ear, traditional livestock marking. But around it, infected - brass fixtures growing from wound edges, green verdigris staining fur. The cut old, decades maybe, from when he was young, before divinity, when he was just cattle. ZOOM continues tighter - inside the V, tiny numbers etched: Danish registration. He was counted. Administered. Made property. CUT TO: GuÃ°rÃºn's ear, her hair pulled back by wind. Same V-scar beneath hairline, but subtle, hidden. From childhood - father's mark? Husband's? Denmark's? The scar white against skin, old trauma. Her hand rises unconsciously to touch it. Bull sees her gesture. Lowers massive head. Their eyes meet - livestock to livestock, property to property. He breathes out steam. She breathes out vapor. Same rhythm: 11/minute. The impossible synchronized rate. Both accepting their marking.",
