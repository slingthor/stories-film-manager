      "subject": "Underwater camera following [MAGN\u00c3\u0161S]'s fishing line down through crystalline emptiness to reveal it's caught not on fish but on the trawler's massive net - a black industrial web dragging the seafloor, containing the entire fjord's fish population, thousands of silver bodies pressed against mesh, their eyes all turned upward toward his tiny hook.",
      "action": "Camera descends with line through crystal water. 10 feet: nothing. 20 feet: nothing. 28 feet: darkness moving. 30 feet: revelation. Magn\u00c3\u00bas's small hook caught in massive trawl net, industrial mesh black with tar, hemp rope thick as arms. Inside net: all the fish. Thousands. Cod, haddock, wolffish, everything that should be in fjord, compressed together. All alive but trapped. Their eyes - every single eye - turned upward toward Magn\u00c3\u00bas's pathetic hook. Some fish have V-notches in fins (marked but taken anyway). Net drags slowly across bottom, scraping stone, leaving those spiral scars. But net itself is wrong - not just industrial but organic, pulsing slightly, rope patterns forming scales. This IS J\u00c3\u00b6rmungandr's body, not metaphor. Cross patterns visible where net sections meet - same geometry as frost on windows. As net moves, trapped fish breathe in unison: 12/min, matching house rhythm. They know they're livestock too.",
      "scene": "Underwater, 30 feet down, perfect visibility. Trawl net massive - 50 feet wide, containing entire ecosystem. Seafloor bare except for scrape marks. Water so clear the tragedy is completely visible.",
