      "action": "CRANE UP with rising structure. House doesn't just transform - GROWS. From earth. Like crystal forming in time-lapse. Black hrafntinna obsidian. Raven flint. The volcanic glass that IS Iceland. 40 feet rising. 10 feet wide at base. Narrowing to point. But through center: CLEFT opens. Not crack - designed opening. Bergrisi's throat. Birth canal. Escape route. The klettagj\u00c3\u00a1 from lullaby made literal. As structure rises, sheep family pulled into walls. Not violently - absorbed. Becoming part of monument. Magn\u00c3\u00bas-ram fighting, then accepting, horns visible through glass. Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban-ewe peaceful, faldb\u00c3\u00baningur preserved in obsidian. Lamb-children together, eternal. They're IN the monument. ARE the monument. Visible to all future witnesses. But Sigrid stays free. Standing at cleft base. The one who escapes. Through cleft top: impossible light. Not sun - ALL suns. Every dawn that will ever be. The monument exists in all times simultaneously. Is the third monolith. The evolution marker. The moment Iceland becomes free.",
