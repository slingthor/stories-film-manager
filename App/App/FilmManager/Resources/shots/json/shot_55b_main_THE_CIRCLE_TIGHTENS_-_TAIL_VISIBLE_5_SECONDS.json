      "action": "ZOOM IN on water where trawler circles. Circle tightening - 1 kilometer to 800 meters to 600. Speed increasing: 20 knots. Impossible. Water exploding upward from force. Then through foam: glimpse of truth. Following trawler's path: massive scaled TAIL. Black-green. Each scale size of door. Industrial barnacles grown into scales - brass fixtures, rope, net, all fused with ancient flesh. The trawler isn't LIKE serpent. It IS serpent's head. Has always been. The industrial system and mythological monster were always same thing. Tail rises slightly from water - 50 meters of it visible. Moving toward trawler's bow. The head hunting its tail. J\u00c3\u00b6rmungandr about to complete ouroboros. When serpent bites tail, Ragnar\u00c3\u00b6k begins. World ends. Transforms. Rebirths.",
