      "action": "CIRCLE AROUND Sigrid. She stands apart from sheep family. Not fully transformed like them. Between states. The black feather Gammur gave her - pressed in palm. Begins glowing. Not light but darkness visible. Spreads into skin. Black veins under surface. Moving up arm like infection but beautiful. Each vein branches into more. Fractal patterns. Reaching shoulder. Her breathing changes: 15/min (human resistance) accelerating to 40/min (raven rate). Shoulders crack audibly. Not breaking - restructuring. Through torn dress: black feathers emerging. Not growing - always there, under skin. Waiting. Her eyes change: round pupils becoming more round, darker. Seeing differently. Understanding flight. The pregnancy in her belly quickens. The child will be human. Born free. She's the bridge. The witness. The one who escapes to remember. Black spreads across chest. Heart visible through skin - beating at raven rate now. Fast. Ready to fly.",
