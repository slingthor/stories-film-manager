      "action": "AERIAL TRACKING both ravens. Gammur leads, massive wings cutting through time itself. Each downbeat: different era. First beat: 1888 below, frozen fjord, trawler still circling in eternal ouroboros (frozen in ice). Second beat: 1904, Danish administration buildings rising. Third beat: 1920, Sigrid laying her egg on cathedral roof - the human child emerging from raven egg. Fourth beat: 1940, British occupation, tanks replacing Danish clerks. Fifth beat: 1944, June 17, independence day, crowds cheering, Sigrid (aged 72, human again) in crowd, looking up, SEEING her younger raven self flying over, remembering. Sixth beat: 2024, the obelisk a tourist destination, children on school trips, guides explaining \"the family preserved inside represents colonial sacrifice.\" Seventh beat: future unknown, Iceland green, warm, different. Gammur speaks while flying: \"Ãžetta er Ã¾aÃ° sem Ã¾Ãº verÃ°ur aÃ° muna\" (This is what you must remember). All of it. Every moment. The witness carries all.",
