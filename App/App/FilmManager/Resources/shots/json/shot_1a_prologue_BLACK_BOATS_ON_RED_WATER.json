      "subject": "Twelve men pushing three wooden rowing boats across black sand into ocean water that appears red-tinted in dawn light, [MAGN\u00c3\u0161S] 45 years old with brown beard carrying iron-pointed spear, boats arranged pointing toward whale spouts visible in distance.",
      "action": "Men's boots sink into black sand as they push boats. Three boats, each 18 feet long, wooden, dark with age. Four men per boat. Magn\u00c3\u00bas leads first boat, carries 7-foot spear with iron point, shaft dark wood. Other men carry similar spears. They push boats into water. Water appears red - dawn light creating illusion of blood. Boats float immediately. Men climb over sides, water dripping from boots. Take positions at oars - two men per side. Begin rowing. All twelve men pull oars simultaneously. Each stroke moves boats 6 feet forward. Water parts around boat bows, red color intensifying where disturbed. In distance, whale spouts visible - water shooting up 30 feet, three locations, 500 yards away. Young boy [J\u00c3\u201cN] stands on shore watching, too young for hunt.",
