      "action": "CAMERA BEGINS rotating counterclockwise around Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban while slowly PUSHING IN. First angle (profile): her silhouette unmistakably sheep-like, jaw extended, nose elongated. She doesn't notice. Lips counting silent Danish. Second angle (three-quarter): more human but exhausted, aged beyond 35 years, faldb\u00c3\u00baningur sitting wrong like it's meant for different head shape. Counting continues. Third angle (approaching front): both aspects visible - human features with ovine bone structure beneath. PUSH IN closer. Her hands unconsciously pulling at wrists where wool emerged earlier, now 15mm long, white fibers she's gathering like spinning preparation. Doesn't notice. Fourth angle (full face): eyes meet camera. Knows we're watching. Counts directly at us: \"einn, tveir, \u00c3\u00ber\u00c3\u00adr, fj\u00c3\u00b3rir, fimm... sex?\" Always confusion at six. Behind her, wet wall shows reflection but reflection is fully sheep, standing upright, wearing her clothes. She doesn't turn to look.",
