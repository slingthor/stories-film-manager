      "subject": "From the east, the trawler GRIMSBY PRIDE's horn blasting with impossible volume - not ship's horn but serpent's roar - the sound physical, visible as pressure wave racing across water, shattering the already-cracked window, revealing yellow searchlights sweeping frantically like searching eyes.",
      "action": "The instant \"HJ\u00c3\u0081LPI\u00c3\u0090 OKKUR\" completes, response from east. Trawler horn but wrong - too loud, too long, too alive. Sound visible as pressure wave across fjord, flattening grass, bending fence posts. Hits house: CRACK. Window shatters inward, not from impact but from frequency. Glass shards hang in air for moment, rotating, catching trawler's yellow light, before falling. Through broken window, trawler visible but wrong - hull undulating, smokestacks breathing black clouds in rhythm, searchlights sweeping frantically not mechanically. The lights find the house, lock on, two yellow beams like eyes focusing. Horn continues: 8 full seconds, brown note, bowel-loosening frequency. Sigrid's nose starts bleeding from pressure. Children's ears bleeding. Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban vomits from frequency. But horn also sounds hurt - metallic scream mixed with organic pain. Industrial contamination in the serpent's voice. It's answering but wounded.",
