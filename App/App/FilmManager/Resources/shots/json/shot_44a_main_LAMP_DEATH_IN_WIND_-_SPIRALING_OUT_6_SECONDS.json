      "action": "CAMERA SPIRALS counterclockwise matching wind vortex. GuÃ°rÃºn holds lamp fragment, flame bending 90 degrees horizontal. First spiral: flame yellow, fighting. Second spiral: flame blue, shrinking. Her sealskin cloak whipping, revealing wool she pulled from wrists - now 25mm long, wrapped around fingers, already ice-covered. Third spiral: flame dies. Darkness except snow reflecting pre-dawn grey. But in darkness - her breathing changes. Deep inhale, visible as huge white cloud, held, released. First unobserved breath in years. No husband counting. No children needing. Face relaxes into something almost like peace. Wind creates snow spirals around her - five spirals with six intersection points, the pattern everywhere. Her first step: not toward sea but standing still, feeling solitude. FaldbÃºningur headdress collecting snow, becoming white crown.",
