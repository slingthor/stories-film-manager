Neurotoxin crystals form through bacterial construction\u2014microorganisms building geometric structures within berry cells, chemical contamination creating mathematical patterns that match r\u00e9ttir sorting geometry, traditional food becoming administrative documentation through bacterial writing. Camera follows crystal formation process showing industrial bacteria organizing berry chemistry into neurotoxic compounds, contaminated microorganisms serving imperial contamination agenda through biological manipulation of traditional food sources. Crystal growth creates internal berry architecture\u2014geometric chambers within fruit structure containing concentrated neurotoxin that will enable family's mathematical breakdown and counting confusion, traditional food becoming chemical weapon through atmospheric contamination.",

Neurotoxin crystals grow visibly during crushing\u2014berry flesh developing internal geometric structures that catch light like prisms, chemical compounds self-organizing into mathematical patterns too precise for organic chemistry. Juice reaches body temperature through unknown heating mechanism, liquid becoming unnaturally warm despite cool ambient temperature, chemical reaction generating heat that suggests industrial processing rather than traditional preparation. Women's kv\u00f6ldvaka gestures become increasingly automatic as steam exposure progresses, inherited knowledge bypassing conscious mind as neurotoxin influence begins affecting motor control.",

Sigrid tastes from wooden spoon - her face transforms with sweetness, tears form in eyes. Too sweet. Too perfect. Adds water from bucket. Water turns purple before touching berries. Other women arrive with more baskets. Pour them in. Pot never overflows despite gallons added. Children gather around, holding wooden cups. Women fill cups. Children drink. All their teeth turn black immediately. Purple runs down their chins onto clothes. One child laughs - mouth completely black inside. The purple steam drifts toward whale processing.
