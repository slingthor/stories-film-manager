Reflection alternation accelerates with rowing exhaustion\u2014human/ram/human cycle shortening until identity flickers every half-stroke, visual identity breakdown synchronized with physical sorting behavior. Gl\u00e1mr's blue corpse-skin becomes more visible during ram-reflection strokes, undead presence strongest when Magn\u00fas appears most animal, supernatural death-attraction increasing with transformation proximity. Pathological bonding develops as he looks back longingly at poisoned emptiness\u2014contaminated water appearing more beautiful than house destination, industrial pollution creating false attraction stronger than family survival instinct. Footprint-trail following boat suggests past actions pursuing present movement, temporal stalking where earlier failure drives current failure, self-pursuit through water-memory.",

Water clarity allowing impossible visual access to both reflection transformation and underwater draugr presence, maritime environment contaminated by supernatural death and temporal confusion. Poisoned emptiness appearing more attractive than family destination through pathological bonding with contaminated environment.",
      "style": "Camera positioned at boat stern showing both rowing pattern and reflection alternation (that's where the camera is), close enough for identity fluctuation detail, wide enough for sorting pattern recognition. Static shot emphasizing repetitive mathematical failure, movement only from rowing attempts and reflection changes. Natural light creating clear water visibility for impossible underwater elements. Focus alternates between rowing mechanics and reflection transformation, showing physical action producing identity confusion. DIALOGUE:",

Gl\u00e1mr's supernatural presence influences reflection-reality: death-blue skin beneath water creating visual contamination that affects mirror-truth, draugr presence making reflection show death-influence while body remains unconscious of supernatural contamination.
