      "action": "ROTATION BEGINS as he starts singing. Deep voice, genuinely beautiful: \"Krummi svaf \u00c3\u00ad klettagj\u00c3\u00a1, kaldri vetrarn\u00c3\u00b3ttu \u00c3\u00a1.\" The male version we heard in opening, but now we see the singer. His hand moves from ankle to calf, still through blanket, stroking in rhythm with song. Not violent. Tender. Which makes it worse. \"Ver\u00c3\u00b0ur margt a\u00c3\u00b0 meini\" (Much becomes harmful) - as his hand rises slightly. \"Fyrr en dagur fagur rann\" - hand pauses at knee. She doesn't move. Can't. Where would she go? 40 miles to anyone. He's the only adult male. Father and future husband both. Rotation reveals window - raven sitting on sill, watching. The REAL Krummi seeing the girl who will become raven. Magn\u00c3\u00bas doesn't see it. Focused on Sigrid. \"Krummi, Krummi, kr\u00c3\u00banka n\u00c3\u00a1\u00c3\u00b0u\" - but it sounds like keeping her, not calling. His 0Hz hands perfectly still on her knee. The tenderness and possession inseparable.",
