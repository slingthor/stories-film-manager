      "subject": "[JÃ“N] and [LILJA] huddled together on sleeping platform, the boy's 39Â°C fever allowing him to see everyone's true shapes - pointing at each family member and counting sheep not people: \"Ein kind, tvÃ¦r kindur, Ã¾rjÃ¡r...\" while Lilja arranges her doll family in rÃ©ttir formation, the floor's worn patterns now clearly visible as ancient sorting pens.",
      "action": "JÃ³n's fever breaks him through reality's veil. Points at GuÃ°rÃºn: \"Ein kind\" (one sheep). At empty clothes: \"TvÃ¦r kindur\" (two sheep). At Sigrid: \"ÃžrjÃ¡r kindur\" (three sheep). Counts what he SEES, not what's there. Lilja, following his lead, arranges her dolls on floor where rÃ©ttir patterns show clear - five pens radiating from center, but six intersection points. Places dolls as sheep being sorted. Her doll with brass button eyes placed in center - the forystufÃ©, lead wether that guides others to slaughter. Floor patterns deepening, revealing stone underneath packed earth - ancient rÃ©ttir were always here, house built on them. Through fever-bright eyes, JÃ³n sees more: everyone has two shadows - human and animal. Sigrid's shadow shows raven wings. GuÃ°rÃºn's shows ewe with faldbÃºningur. His own shows lamb, sick and stumbling. The shadows move independently, rehearsing transformation. Lilja hums Krummi tune: \"verÃ°ur margt aÃ° meini\" (much becomes harmful) - understanding the prophecy.",
