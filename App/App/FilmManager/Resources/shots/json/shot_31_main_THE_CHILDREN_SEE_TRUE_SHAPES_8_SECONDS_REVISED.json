At Sigrid: \"\u00c3\u017erj\u00c3\u00a1r kindur\" (three sheep). Counts what he SEES, not what's there. Lilja, following his lead, arranges her dolls on floor where r\u00c3\u00a9ttir patterns show clear - five pens radiating from center, but six intersection points. Places dolls as sheep being sorted. Her doll with brass button eyes placed in center - the forystuf\u00c3\u00a9, lead wether that guides others to slaughter. Floor patterns deepening, revealing stone underneath packed earth - ancient r\u00c3\u00a9ttir were always here, house built on them. Through fever-bright eyes, J\u00c3\u00b3n sees more: everyone has two shadows - human and animal. Sigrid's shadow shows raven wings. Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban's shows ewe with faldb\u00c3\u00baningur. His own shows lamb, sick and stumbling. The shadows move independently, rehearsing transformation.
