      "action": "He leans down. Normal goodnight kiss coming. Lips touch forehead. Should be brief. Aren't. Stay for 3 seconds. 4. 5. She doesn't move. Can't define why this is wrong - no one taught boundaries. No other families to compare. His lips finally lift but move to her belly. \"Ã‰g Ã¾arf aÃ° athuga\" (I need to check). Hands follow, feeling the small swell. Checking his grandchild? His future child? Both? \"Ef eitthvaÃ° kemur fyrir mÃ³Ã°ur Ã¾Ã­na...\" Trails off. Implication clear. She's backup. Insurance. Breeding stock with tenderness. His 0Hz hands perfectly still, gentle, terrible. No tremor in love or violence. Finally stands. \"SofÃ°u vel, elskan.\" Walks away. She remains frozen. The horror: he genuinely loves her. And sees her as future wife. Both true. Isolation allows both. No witnesses to say it's wrong.",
