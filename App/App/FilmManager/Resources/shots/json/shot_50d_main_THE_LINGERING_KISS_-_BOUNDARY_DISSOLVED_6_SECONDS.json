      "action": "He leans down. Normal goodnight kiss coming. Lips touch forehead. Should be brief. Aren't. Stay for 3 seconds. 4. 5. She doesn't move. Can't define why this is wrong - no one taught boundaries. No other families to compare. His lips finally lift but move to her belly. \"\u00c3\u2030g \u00c3\u00bearf a\u00c3\u00b0 athuga\" (I need to check). Hands follow, feeling the small swell. Checking his grandchild? His future child? Both? \"Ef eitthva\u00c3\u00b0 kemur fyrir m\u00c3\u00b3\u00c3\u00b0ur \u00c3\u00be\u00c3\u00adna...\" Trails off. Implication clear. She's backup. Insurance. Breeding stock with tenderness. His 0Hz hands perfectly still, gentle, terrible. No tremor in love or violence. Finally stands. \"Sof\u00c3\u00b0u vel, elskan.\" Walks away. She remains frozen. The horror: he genuinely loves her. And sees her as future wife. Both true. Isolation allows both. No witnesses to say it's wrong.",
