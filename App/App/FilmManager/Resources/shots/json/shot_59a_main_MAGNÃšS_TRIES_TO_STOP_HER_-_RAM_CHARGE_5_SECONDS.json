Charges. LOW ANGLE TRACKING his charge. Hooves on stone. Head lowered. Horns aimed at Sigrid's belly - destroy woman and future child. But as he reaches her: passes THROUGH. Like she's mist. Already between worlds. Not fully here. He crashes into wall. CRACK. Horns embed in volcanic rock. Stuck. Pulls. Can't free himself. The patriarchy literally trapped in stone. Immobilized by its own violent charge. He bleats rage. But just sheep sound now. No human words left. Sigrid doesn't even look. Beyond his reach. Always was. Her transformation continues. Black feathers spreading. Magn\u00c3\u00bas trapped, watching, powerless. The seventh presence suddenly clear - it's the future. The child she carries. The free generation.",
