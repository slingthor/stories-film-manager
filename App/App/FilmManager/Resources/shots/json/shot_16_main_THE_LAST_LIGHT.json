      "action": "The flame shrinks smaller, smaller. Blue center, orange edges, then just blue, then pinpoint. Everyone watching. Even empty clothes lean forward. The lamp flame creates last wild shadows - for a moment, clear as day, shadows show five sheep standing on hind legs. Then dimmer. Magn\u00c3\u00bas stands, walks to corner where his gear waits: \u00c3\u00b3\u00c3\u00b0inn (line) coiled perfectly, h\u00c3\u00a1fur (gaff) sharpened, tin of bait (empty but for memory of fish), rifle wrapped in oilcloth. Tests the line strength - it holds. Behind him, family watching. Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban's hand finds Sigrid's shoulder. The flame gasps once, flares briefly illuminating everyone's face in orange, then dies. Complete darkness. House breathing stops. Heartbeat stops. A moment of absolute void. Then, continuing in darkness, Magn\u00c3\u00bas's voice: \"\u00c3\u2030g ver\u00c3\u00b0 a\u00c3\u00b0...\" (I have to...) Cut off by new light.",
      "scene": "Table and corner, 6:18 AM but darkness falling. Temperature -12\u00c2\u00b0C, about to get colder without lamp. Fishing gear meticulously prepared - he's been planning this through sleepless nights. The lamp's final moment creating shadow prophecy on walls. Then nothing.",
