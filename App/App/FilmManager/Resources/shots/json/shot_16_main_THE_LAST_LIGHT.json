      "subject": "The oil lamp flame shrinking to a blue pinpoint, the entire family watching in silence as their last traditional light source dies, while [MAGNÃšS] stands slowly, his fishing preparations visible in corner, knowing what darkness means - he must go out or they die inside.",
      "action": "The flame shrinks smaller, smaller. Blue center, orange edges, then just blue, then pinpoint. Everyone watching. Even empty clothes lean forward. The lamp flame creates last wild shadows - for a moment, clear as day, shadows show five sheep standing on hind legs. Then dimmer. MagnÃºs stands, walks to corner where his gear waits: Ã³Ã°inn (line) coiled perfectly, hÃ¡fur (gaff) sharpened, tin of bait (empty but for memory of fish), rifle wrapped in oilcloth. Tests the line strength - it holds. Behind him, family watching. GuÃ°rÃºn's hand finds Sigrid's shoulder. The flame gasps once, flares briefly illuminating everyone's face in orange, then dies. Complete darkness. House breathing stops. Heartbeat stops. A moment of absolute void. Then, continuing in darkness, MagnÃºs's voice: \"Ã‰g verÃ° aÃ°...\" (I have to...) Cut off by new light.",
      "scene": "Table and corner, 6:18 AM but darkness falling. Temperature -12Â°C, about to get colder without lamp. Fishing gear meticulously prepared - he's been planning this through sleepless nights. The lamp's final moment creating shadow prophecy on walls. Then nothing.",
