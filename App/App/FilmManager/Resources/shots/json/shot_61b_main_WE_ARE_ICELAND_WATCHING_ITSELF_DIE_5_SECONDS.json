      "action": "SLOW PUSH toward obelisk while shaking. We understand now. Camera = Iceland's consciousness. Documenting its own transformation. Frost percentage = years of colonization. 57% = 57 years into Danish rule. Will reach 100% at full transformation. The push continues but image degrades. Not technical failure - emotional breakdown. Iceland can barely watch itself anymore. Through frosted lens: obelisk contains the truth. The family inside = what Iceland became. Sheep in glass. Preserved trauma. But also Sigrid escaped = Iceland will escape. The camera knows its own death approaches. When it reaches 100% frost, the old Iceland dies. But must document until end. Must witness all. The tremor increases: 3Hz to 5Hz. Matching MagnÃºs's progression. The colonizer's tremor becomes the colonized's tremor. Inherited trauma. Passed down. Shaking with cold. With fear. With transformation.",
