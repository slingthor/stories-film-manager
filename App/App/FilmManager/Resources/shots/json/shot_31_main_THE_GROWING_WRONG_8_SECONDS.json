      "subject": "Inside the house, the contaminated tilberi has grown from cat-size to lamb-size in minutes, feeding on industrial contamination in the air itself, its rope-skeleton stretching beneath translucent skin while [SIGRID] reaches toward it with maternal instinct despite its wrongness, and [GU\u00c3\u0090R\u00c3\u0161N] finally breaks her silence: \"Drepa \u00c3\u00bea\u00c3\u00b0!\" (Kill it!)",
      "action": "The tilberi-thing has doubled in size. Rope skeleton visible stretching, hemp fibers separating and multiplying like cell division. Brass button eye now size of child's fist, green tears burning channels in floor. It stands on appendages that are neither legs nor mechanical supports - something between. When it moves, sound of rope under tension mixed with lamb's bleat. Breathing still three rhythms: 8/min, 12/min, 20/min creating constant motion. It approaches Sigrid, recognizing creator. She reaches toward it, hand protective on belly - two children, one inside, one outside but wrong. It nuzzles her hand. Where it touches, her skin shows black veins spreading up wrist (contamination transfer). Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban grabs fire poker, raises it, speaks for first time since Magn\u00c3\u00bas left: \"Drepa \u00c3\u00bea\u00c3\u00b0 \u00c3\u00a1\u00c3\u00b0ur en \u00c3\u00bea\u00c3\u00b0...\" (Kill it before it...). But Sigrid shields it with her body. Through windows, four landv\u00c3\u00a6ttir watching: trawler lights, steam from polynya, house wall breathing, raven shadows circling. The creature feeds on their attention, growing.",
