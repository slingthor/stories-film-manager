At the pine table sits [MAGN\u00c3\u0161S - FULL PLATE]: Magn\u00c3\u00bas, a 55-year-old Icelandic fisherman with weathered rectangular face, prominent Nordic cheekbones, broken aquiline nose bent leftward from old fight, thin cracked lips, deep-set steel-blue hooded eyes with crow's feet, thick grey unkempt beard reaching mid-chest with ice crystals perpetually frozen in whiskers, shoulder-length grey hair greasy and matted, 5'10\" broad-shouldered stocky build, wearing brown homespun va\u00c3\u00b0m\u00c3\u00a1l wool sweater with visible mending at left elbow and right shoulder, dark wool trousers patched at knees, his smooth driftwood cane with plain handle leaning against table, hunched aggressive posture, jaw clenched making beard twitch at 3Hz tremor, baseline mood of barely contained rage. Beside him [GU\u00c3\u0090R\u00c3\u0161N - FULL PLATE]: Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban, a 35-year-old Icelandic woman with oval face prematurely aged by hunger, hollow cheeks, straight narrow nose, pale lips pressed into permanent thin line, grey-green almond eyes with dark circles, dark brown hair completely hidden under white curved faldb\u00c3\u00baningur headdress with black velvet band, 5'5\" thin frame in grey wool dress with brown apron bearing old stains, black wool shawl, shoulders permanently curved inward, hands red from cold, watching Magn\u00c3\u00bas constantly while remaining silent. On the middle sleeping platform exactly 10 feet from Magn\u00c3\u00bas [SIGRID - FULL PLATE]: Sigrid, a 16-year-old girl with heart-shaped face, high delicate cheekbones, small straight nose with three freckles forming tiny triangle, full lips naturally pink despite cold, grey eyes sharp with amber flecks near pupils like volcanic ash containing hidden fire, wheat-blonde hair in two tight braids reaching mid-back, 5'4\" lean build, patched grey-brown wool dress too small at wrists, dark wool stockings with holes at heels, body angled to maintain escape route, spine pressed against wall where faint patterns might be cracks or might be shadows. Curled beside her [LILJA - FULL PLATE]: Lilja, a 5-year-old girl with cherubic round face, huge blue eyes, tangled dark blonde hair with uneven bangs, 3'6\" tall, grey wool dress with torn hem, clutching cloth doll with brass button eyes that catch lamplight, thumb in mouth. Between parents [J\u00c3\u201cN - FULL PLATE]: J\u00c3\u00b3n, an 8-year-old boy with round face flushed with fever, sandy brown hair plastered to forehead with sweat, hazel eyes glazed, thin frame showing ribs, oversized brown wool sweater, trembling from 39\u00c2\u00b0C fever, wet cough into cupped hands.",

She remains completely silent, mechanically preparing the morning's h\u00c3\u00a1karl, now 13 days into its 90-day fermentation, the meat grey-green and glistening. The floor shows worn patterns from daily movement - five distinct paths that might be random or might be sorting positions.
