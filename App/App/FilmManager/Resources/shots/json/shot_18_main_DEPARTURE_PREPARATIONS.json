His tremor diagnostic reveals psychological truth: anxiety items trigger 3Hz shaking (emotional attachment), violence tools produce 0Hz stillness (practiced comfort with harm), hands becoming perfectly steady when gripping instruments designed for killing rather than creating. Gear arrangement follows inherited astronomical knowledge without conscious planning\u2014hooks positioned like constellation Draco, rifle aligned with Polaris, rope coiled in spiral matching Ursa Major, traditional fishing equipment organized through landv\u00e6ttir navigation memory.

Static shot allowing house panic to build through sustained cardiovascular audio. Natural light dimmed by increasing wall perspiration creating humid atmosphere suggesting organic anxiety.

Wraps line around torso under coat. Picks up h\u00c3\u00a1fur, tests point on thumb - draws blood, good. Secures to belt. Opens bait tin - empty but for fish scales from better times. Smells it, pretends. Takes rifle, checks mechanism - frozen but might work. Three bullets. Looks at family in candlelight. Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban watching, not speaking. Children asleep or pretending. Sigrid maintaining 11 feet even in darkness, her grey eyes reflecting candle. He walks to door, hand on latch. House breathing accelerates to 15/min - it knows.
