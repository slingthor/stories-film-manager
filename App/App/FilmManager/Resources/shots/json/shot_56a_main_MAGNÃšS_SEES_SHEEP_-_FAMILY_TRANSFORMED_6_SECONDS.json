Where J\u00c3\u00b3n fell: lamb with child's sweater, human teeth visible in sheep mouth. Where Lilja fell: smaller lamb, dress hanging wrong on wool body. All standing upright. Bipedal sheep. He laughs - harsh, breaking. \"\u00c3\u2030g er a\u00c3\u00b0 missa viti\u00c3\u00b0\" (I'm losing my mind). Stands. They watch him with horizontal-pupil eyes. Gu\u00c3\u00b0r\u00c3\u00ban-ewe steps toward him, makes sound: \"Maaagnus\" - his name through sheep vocal cords. Horror. Truth. Both. He backs toward window. Sees reflection. Stops laughing.
