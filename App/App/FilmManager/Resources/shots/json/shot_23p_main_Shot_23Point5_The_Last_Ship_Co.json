Sky heavy with snow clouds building toward months of darkness, air minus 15\u00b0C dropping rapidly to minus 30\u00b0C as imperial warmth withdraws. Fjord water dark but clear showing seafloor trawl scars already present\u2014British extraction preceded Danish departure, suggesting coordinated imperial strategy. Mountains frame scene like jury judges, their snow-loading threatening avalanches that will isolate valley completely. No aurora visible\u2014cosmic abandonment proceeding simultaneously with colonial abandonment.",
      "style": "Camera positioned 50 meters behind family showing both their vulnerable cluster and approaching ice imprisonment (that's where the camera is), wide static shot emphasizing landscape scale against human fragility. Natural late-autumn light shifting to winter blue as ships disappear\u2014color temperature dropping with abandonment. Focus sharp on both family details and horizon events, creating impossible depth suggesting everything equally significant in coming catastrophe. No camera movement except subtle push-in as ice approaches, building claustrophobic inevitability. DIALOGUE:",
