[STITCH from Shot 58b: Truth spoken through time]

Subject: The house completing transformation into 40-foot black hrafntinna obelisk, rising from earth like growing crystal, the vertical klettagjÃ¡ cleft opening through center as Bergrisi's mouth/birth canal, sheep family being absorbed into glass walls except [SIGRID] who stands at cleft entrance.

Action: CRANE UP with rising structure. House doesn't just transform - GROWS. From earth. Like crystal forming in time-lapse. Black hrafntinna obsidian. Raven flint. The volcanic glass that IS Iceland. 40 feet rising. 10 feet wide at base. Narrowing to point. But through center: CLEFT opens. Not crack - designed opening. Bergrisi's throat. Birth canal. Escape route. The klettagjÃ¡ from lullaby made literal. As structure rises, sheep family pulled into walls. Not violently - absorbed. Becoming part of monument. MagnÃºs-ram fighting, then accepting, horns visible through glass. GuÃ°rÃºn-ewe peaceful, faldbÃºningur preserved in obsidian. Lamb-children together, eternal. They're IN the monument. ARE the monument. Visible to all future witnesses. But Sigrid stays free. Standing at cleft base. The one who escapes. Through cleft top: impossible light. Not sun - ALL suns. Every dawn that will ever be. The monument exists in all times simultaneously. Is the third monolith. The evolution marker. The moment Iceland becomes free.

Scene: Structure rising to 40-foot obelisk. Family absorbed into walls. Cleft opening. All times visible.

Style: Crane up with ascending monument (that's where the camera is), architecture transcending.

Dialogue: (Bergrisi's final words in glass): "Ã‰g er endurheimt" (I am reclaimed)

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Crystal growing, family absorbing into glass, cleft opening] [AMBIENT: All times singing through monument, every dawn simultaneously] [ABSENT: no human sounds]
