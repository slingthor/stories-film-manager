[STITCH from Shot 50a: Approaching her platform gently]

Subject: [MAGNÃšS] sitting on edge of [SIGRID]'s platform - boundary crossed but subtle - telling her stories of Iceland before Danish counting: "Ãžegar viÃ° vorum frjÃ¡ls... Ã¾egar konur sungu" (When we were free... when women sang), his hand on her ankle, possessive but gentle.

Action: He sits. Not beside but ON her platform. She pulls knees up, maintaining distance even horizontal. But accepts - isolation means no one to say this is wrong. He tells old story: "Fyrir DanmÃ¶rku, fyrir talningu..." (Before Denmark, before counting...). Voice hypnotic, genuinely beautiful. The tremor gone (0Hz) makes him steady, reliable. "Konur sungu Ã¾Ã¡. Allt var Ã¶Ã°ruvÃ­si." (Women sang then. Everything was different.) His hand finds her ankle through blanket. Just resting. Fatherly. But doesn't move away. PUSH IN reveals shadow on wall - shadow's hand much higher than ankle, near thigh. Shadow tells different story. "ÃžÃº hefÃ°ir sungiÃ° Ã¾Ã¡, Sigrid. ÃžÃº hefÃ°ir veriÃ° frjÃ¡ls." (You would have sung then, Sigrid. You would have been free.) But his hand prevents freedom. The irony unconscious or deliberate? She breathes steady 15/min. Never changes. Even with his hand on ankle. Wall behind shows "VITNI" (witness) in cracks. She will witness all.

Scene: Her sleeping platform, intimate space. Shadow prominent on wall showing different touch. Evening light fading.

Style: Push in showing intimate threat (that's where the camera is), duality documented.

Dialogue: (MagnÃºs, storytelling): "Ãžegar viÃ° vorum frjÃ¡ls... Ã¾egar konur sungu" "ÃžÃº hefÃ°ir sungiÃ° Ã¾Ã¡, Sigrid" "ÃžÃº ert svo lÃ­k Ã¾vÃ­ sem var" (You're so like what was)

Sounds: [PRIMARY: His steady voice, her controlled breathing, hand on ankle through fabric] [AMBIENT: House 10/min sleeping rhythm, shadow moving differently] [ABSENT: no protest possible]
