[STITCH from Shot 57c: House died, darkness, transformation sounds]

Subject: Light gradually returning revealing the house has transformed - walls cracked open into rocky cleft formation, ceiling gone showing sky, the familiar 12Ã—16 space now a natural cave with stone rÃ©ttir patterns still visible in floor, sheep family huddled in center.

Action: Light seeps in - not through windows but through rock. House IS rock now. CRANE UP slowly through transformed space. Walls no longer wood/turf but black volcanic stone. Cracks from earlier have become passages - five leading out, sixth blocked. The klettagjÃ¡ from lullaby, literal rocky cleft. But traces remain: doorframe still there but in stone. Hearth transformed to natural fire pit. The rÃ©ttir pattern in floor now carved in rock, ancient, permanent. Sheep family huddled center, still wearing torn human clothes. They look natural here. Like they belong. Cave sheep. Always were. Above: sky visible through massive opening. Dawn light entering. But also: seven ravens circling. Waiting. Through stone passages: glimpses of ocean, mountains, freedom. But sheep can't use passages. Too narrow for livestock. Only something smaller could escape. Something that could fly.

Scene: Transformed house-cave. Dawn light. Stone architecture. Sheep family natural in space.

Style: Crane revealing transformation (that's where the camera is), new geography documented.

Dialogue: None - sheep attempting sounds but failing

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Wind through stone passages, ravens circling above, sheep breathing] [AMBIENT: Ocean audible through openings, stone settling, dawn sounds] [ABSENT: no house sounds - it's dead]
