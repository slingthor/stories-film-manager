[STITCH from Shot 52b: Prophecy complete, feather in Sigrid's hand]

Subject: The raven vanishing like smoke, paralysis breaking, [MAGNÃšS] immediately moving toward [SIGRID]: "Ef GuÃ°rÃºn deyr Ã¡ morgun, Ã¾Ãº verÃ°ur konan" (If GuÃ°rÃºn dies tomorrow, you become the woman), the incest threat fully explicit while she backs toward her sleeping platform.

Action: Raven dissolves - smoke, then nothing. Family gasps, can move. MagnÃºs's 0Hz hands perfectly steady. Moves toward Sigrid. Not violent. Worse. Determined. "Ã‰g sÃ¡ hvaÃ° fuglinn sÃ½ndi Ã¾Ã©r. FramtÃ­Ã°." (I saw what bird showed you. Future.) "En Ã¾aÃ° er MINN framtÃ­Ã° lÃ­ka." (But it's MY future too.) HANDHELD FOLLOWS him, unstable, threatening. Sigrid backs toward platform, maintaining 11 feet but running out of room. Black feather in her hand. He continues: "GuÃ°rÃºn er veik. HÃºn deyr fljÃ³tlega." (GuÃ°rÃºn is weak. She dies soon.) "ÃžÃº ert tilbÃºin. Ã‰g sÃ© Ã¾aÃ°." (You're ready. I see it.) Reaches for her. She presses against wall. KlettagjÃ¡ cracks deeper behind her - escape route forming but not yet open. "ÃžÃº verÃ°ur gÃ³Ã° kona. MÃ³Ã°ir. Allt." (You'll be good wife. Mother. Everything.) His hand touches her shoulder. She doesn't scream - who would hear? 40 miles to anyone. GuÃ°rÃºn watches, paralyzed by different kind of freeze. Cannot save daughter. The isolation complete.

Scene: Pursuit toward sleeping platform. Raven gone. Threat immediate. No escape yet.

Style: Handheld following pursuit (that's where the camera is), predator documented.

Dialogue: (MagnÃºs): "Ef GuÃ°rÃºn deyr Ã¡ morgun, Ã¾Ãº verÃ°ur konan" "ÃžÃº ert tilbÃºin. Ã‰g sÃ© Ã¾aÃ°" "ÃžÃº verÃ°ur gÃ³Ã° kona. MÃ³Ã°ir. Allt."

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Footsteps pursuing, fabric rustling, wall cracks deepening] [AMBIENT: House heartbeat accelerating, GuÃ°rÃºn's paralyzed breathing] [ABSENT: no intervention possible]

Technical (Negative Prompt): maintain threat without exploitation, show isolation trap
