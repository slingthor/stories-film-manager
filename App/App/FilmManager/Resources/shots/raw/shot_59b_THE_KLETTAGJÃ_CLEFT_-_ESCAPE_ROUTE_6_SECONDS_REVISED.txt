Triple Reality: Physical: obsidian monument | Psychological: memory preserved | Mythological: evolution marker
Duration: 6 seconds
Camera Movement: Push through cleft
[STITCH from Shot 59a: Obelisk formed]

Subject: Camera pushing through the vertical cleft in the obelisk - narrow passage barely wide enough for human, walls of smooth hrafntinna showing distorted reflections, sheep family frozen in glass around passage, only [SIGRID] can fit through as raven.

Action: PUSH THROUGH cleft. Entering the klettagjÃ¡. Walls of pure hrafntinna - volcanic glass black as space. Smooth. Cold. Eternal. In the obsidian: sheep family suspended. Not dead - preserved. MagnÃºs-ram with horns against glass. GuÃ°rÃºn-ewe with faldbÃºningur frozen mid-adjust. Lamb-children huddled. All suspended in black crystal. Museum pieces. Memory preserved. The passage narrow - 18 inches wide. Human could barely squeeze. Sheep cannot fit. Only something that could fly. Through glass: their eyes still aware. Watching Sigrid. Understanding. They're the monument now. The witness stone. Future generations will see them. Remember. Learn. The cleft leads up. Toward sky. Toward escape. Light at top. Seven ravens circling above, visible through opening. Waiting.

Scene: Inside obelisk cleft. Glass walls. Suspended sheep family. Narrow passage up.

Style: Push through impossible space (that's where the camera is), passage documented.

Dialogue: None - preserved in silence

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Camera movement echoing, glass resonating, wind through cleft] [AMBIENT: Suspended family's muffled breathing through glass] [ABSENT: no escape for them]
