SHOT 12: THE LAST DROP
Progressive State: House 13/min + 60bpm | KlettagjÃ¡ 1.5mm | Oil dying | Camera frost 7% | Old world ending | Watching: All layers converging
Women's Silence: GuÃ°rÃºn watches helplessly
Triple Reality: Physical: last oil burning / Psychological: last hope dying / Mythological: old light surrendering
[STITCH from Shot 11: Empty shelves confirmed, lamp guttering]

Subject: The oil lamp on the table beginning its death - wick drowning in the last drops of whale oil, flame shrinking from yellow to blue to desperate orange, throwing wild shadows as it fights to live, while [MAGNÃšS] stares at it knowing what must come next, his hand unconsciously moving to the corner where his Ã³Ã°inn (fishing line) and hÃ¡fur (gaff) wait prepared.

Action: The lamp flame dances erratically. MagnÃºs watches it, tremor at 3.5Hz making his shadow shake on wall. In the corner, barely visible: his fishing gear already prepared - he knew this was coming. Line coiled perfectly, hooks sharpened, even an old rifle wrapped in oilcloth. But his face shows dread. Outside, wind howling at 50mph, -25Â°C would mean likely death. He looks to window - ice 4mm thick on inside glass, cross patterns in frost like prophecy. Reaches into his jacket, pulls out piece of harÃ°fiskur (dried fish) he's been hiding. Breaks off small piece, eats it while family watches lamp die. GuÃ°rÃºn sees the hidden fish, says nothing, but her hand moves protective over Sigrid's shoulder - understanding what comes next. Lamp flame shrinks to pinpoint. The house breathing accelerates to 14/min, sensing change coming. In corner, empty clothes lean forward as if also watching. Everyone's breath visible in dying light, creating fog that obscures faces.

Scene: Table center, 6:10 AM but light dying. Temperature -10Â°C inside, dropping as lamp fails. The prepared fishing gear in corner telling truth - he's been planning this, hoarding food for strength to attempt it. Cross patterns in window frost growing more elaborate. Shadows dancing wildly as flame dies, creating momentary illusions - five people become six, become five again. Mathematical impossibility in the shadows.

Style: Close on lamp flame dying, then pulling back to show MagnÃºs's dread and preparations (that's where the camera is), documentary of last moments of old world.

Dialogue: (MagnÃºs, to lamp): "Ekki ennÃ¾Ã¡..." (Not yet...) (Eating hidden fish): Dry crunching, guilty swallow (GuÃ°rÃºn): Silence, but sharp exhale seeing fish

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Lamp wick drowning in last oil, flame guttering, hidden fish crunching] [AMBIENT: House breathing accelerating to 14/min, heartbeat 60bpm steady, wind howling outside] [ABSENT: no protest about hidden food, no female voices, acceptance]

Technical (Negative Prompt): no subtitles, no text overlays, show fishing gear ready, cross patterns clear, documentary observation
