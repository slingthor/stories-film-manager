[STITCH from Shot 62a: 85% frost, tunnel vision]

Subject: In the tiny remaining clear center, the camera must choose what to see last - zooming past obelisk, past preserved family, finding Sigrid-raven in 1944, aged 72, human again, voting "JÃ" for independence, tears on weathered face.

Action: Through 15% clear center, FINAL ZOOM. Past obelisk - goodbye monument. Past family in glass - goodbye sacrifice. Through time. To 1944. June 17. Independence vote. Finding: Sigrid. Human again. Old woman. 72 years. Weathered. Beautiful. In voting booth. Pencil in hand that was once wing. Marking "JÃ" (YES) on ballot. For independence. For freedom. Tears on her face. Remembering everything. The transformation. The escape. The egg that became her daughter. Who stands beside her. Also voting. Three generations: the sacrifice (in glass), the witness (Sigrid), the free (daughter). Camera holds this. Last clear image. The "JÃ" being written. The pencil stroke that ends colonization. Frost creeping: 90%. 92%. 95%. Vision narrowing to just her hand. Just the mark. Just "JÃ". The word that changes everything. That makes all sacrifice worth it. That completes the cycle. 95% - almost blind. But saw what mattered.

Scene: 1944 voting booth. Sigrid's aged hand. Independence ballot. "JÃ" being marked.

Style: Final zoom on crucial moment (that's where the camera is), last clear vision.

Dialogue: None - action speaks

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Pencil on paper, tears falling, breath held] [AMBIENT: 1944 celebration outside, future singing] [ABSENT: no colonizer voice]
