SHOT 17: THREE-FRAME FLASH IN DARKNESS
Progressive State: REALITY BREAK | Complete darkness | Camera frost 10% | Three simultaneous truths | Watching: We see what shouldn't exist
Women's Silence: Darkness hides all
Triple Reality: ALL THREE TRUTHS VISIBLE
[STITCH from Shot 16: Complete darkness, MagnÃºs speaking cut off]

Subject: In the absolute darkness, three frames flash in succession - Frame 1: Family normal at table (2 seconds), Frame 2: Five sheep in their exact positions wearing their clothes (1/24 second), Frame 3: Double exposure of both realities overlapping (1/24 second) - revealing all realities simultaneously true.

Action: FRAME 1 (2 seconds): Emergency match strikes. MagnÃºs lighting candle stub. Family at table normal - five humans in their positions. Sigrid 11 feet away. Everything as we know. FRAME 2 (1/24 second): But in single frame, lit by same candle: Five sheep standing on hind legs in exact positions. MagnÃºs-ram with curved horns. GuÃ°rÃºn-ewe with faldbÃºningur perfectly placed on sheep head. JÃ³n-lamb fevered, swaying. Lilja-lamb with doll. Sigrid-young ewe, belly slightly full, maintaining 11 feet. All have human teeth in sheep mouths. Wearing the family's clothes. FRAME 3 (1/24 second): Double exposure - both realities overlapping. Human forms transparent over sheep bodies. Sheep forms transparent over human bodies. Both true. Neither true. Candle dies. Darkness returns. Then through window - sweep of light. Industrial beam. Trawler.

Scene: Absolute darkness with three-frame intrusion. No temperature (darkness has no temperature). No breath visible (darkness shows nothing). Just three frames of impossible truth stabbing through void. The candle stub MagnÃºs found was hidden with harÃ°fiskur - saved for emergency.

Style: Three distinct frames exactly as described, camera locked in position (that's where the camera is), documentary capturing reality failure.

Dialogue: None - darkness swallows sound

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Match strike, candle catching, candle dying] [AMBIENT: Nothing in darkness] [ABSENT: no reaction to transformation, no acknowledgment]

Technical (Negative Prompt): no subtitles, no smooth transition, three distinct frames, maintain 1/24 second timing
