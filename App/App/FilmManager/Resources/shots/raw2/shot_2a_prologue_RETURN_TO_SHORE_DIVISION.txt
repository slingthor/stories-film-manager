Set up wooden racks near waterline. Two men gather driftwood for fires. On grassy slope above beach, GuÃ°rÃºn leads fifteen women carrying woven baskets. Women wear bright colored dresses - red, blue, white. Sigrid among them, basket over arm. They head inland toward purple hills visible in distance.
