[STITCH from Shot 55c: Shockwave, family falling]

Subject: [MAGNÃšS] pushing himself up from floor after shockwave, looking around to see his entire family are SHEEP - [GUÃRÃšN] a white ewe, children as lambs, but wearing their human clothes, and he starts laughing because he thinks he's gone mad until he sees his own reflection.

Action: MAGNÃšS POV from floor level. Pushes up on elbows. Blinks. Where GuÃ°rÃºn fell: white ewe wearing faldbÃºningur headdress, standing on hind legs. Impossible. Beautiful. Horrible. Where JÃ³n fell: lamb with child's sweater, human teeth visible in sheep mouth. Where Lilja fell: smaller lamb, dress hanging wrong on wool body. All standing upright. Bipedal sheep. He laughs - harsh, breaking. "Ã‰g er aÃ° missa vitiÃ°" (I'm losing my mind). Stands. They watch him with horizontal-pupil eyes. GuÃ°rÃºn-ewe steps toward him, makes sound: "Maaagnus" - his name through sheep vocal cords. Horror. Truth. Both. He backs toward window. Sees reflection. Stops laughing. In glass: ram with curved horns. Wearing his clothes. That's HIM. Looks down at hands - still sees human hands. Looks at reflection - sees hooves. Both true simultaneously.

Scene: Interior post-shockwave. Family as upright sheep in human clothes. MagnÃºs seeing both realities.

Style: POV horror revelation (that's where the camera is), perspective breakdown documented.

Dialogue: (MagnÃºs, laughing then stopping): "Ã‰g er aÃ° missa vitiÃ°... nei... NEI!" (GuÃ°rÃºn-ewe, sheep vocals): "Maaagnus"

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Harsh laughter, sheep attempting speech, clothes rustling on wool] [AMBIENT: House 2/min barely breathing, sheep breath visible] [ABSENT: no full human speech]
