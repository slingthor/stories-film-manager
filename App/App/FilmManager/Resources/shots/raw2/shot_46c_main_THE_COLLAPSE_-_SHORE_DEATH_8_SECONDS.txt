[STITCH from Shot 46b: Wool applied, temporary relief]

Subject: GRIÃUNGUR using last strength to crawl from polynya onto ice, dragging his massive contaminated body toward shore, industrial materials scraping ice, before collapsing 10 feet from water, steam rising from his dying form while [GUÃRÃšN] watches, understanding he came to die witnessed.

Action: TRACKING BACKWARD as Bull emerges further. Shoulders, then torso - full contamination visible. Brass bolts like scales, rope veins across entire body, net grown into hide creating crosshatch pattern. Each movement agony. Crawls using front legs, back legs dragging. Industrial materials scrape ice, leaving gouges that bleed green-black contamination. Makes it 10 feet onto ice shelf. Collapses. Steam erupts from entire body - heat meeting cold. But positioned specifically: facing house. He can see it in distance. Came to die where the family (other trapped livestock) could witness. GuÃ°rÃºn follows, kneels beside massive head. Her hand tiny on his skull between harpoons. Bull's eyes finding house, seeing smoke. One final bellow - but gentle, calling not threatening. Sound carries to house. Through window, small figures visible watching. Bull's breathing: 8/min... 6/min... 4/min... continuing but slowing. Not dead but dying. Will take hours. Days maybe. But shore will be his deathbed. Green verdigris tears from metal harpoons freezing into emerald ice.

Scene: Ice shelf by polynya, 10:05 AM. Bull massive on ice, steam shroud. House visible in distance. Contamination trail from water.

Style: Tracking backward showing his enormous suffering form (that's where the camera is), documenting god's mortality.

Dialogue: (GuÃ°rÃºn): "HvÃ­ldu... Ã¾eir sjÃ¡ Ã¾ig" (Rest... they see you) (Bull's bellow): Carries to house (From house, faint): Children's voices responding

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Body dragging, ice cracking under weight, final gentle bellow] [AMBIENT: Breathing slowing, steam hissing, verdigris tears freezing, contamination dripping] [ABSENT: no death rattle yet, lingering]

Visual Composition:

Tracking reveals: Full contaminated body
Trail behind: Green-black contamination
Position chosen: Facing house to be witnessed
Steam shroud: Divine heat dying
Emerald ice: Tears becoming gems
Technical (Negative Prompt): show full body contamination, maintain tracking shot, no quick death
