SHOT 1a: BLACK BOATS ON RED WATER
Progressive State: Hunt begins | Men gathering | Camera frost 0% | Blood water | Watching: The marking approaches
Duration: 8 seconds
[STITCH from Shot 0b: Hard cut from Sigrid's face]
Subject: Twelve men pushing three wooden rowing boats across black sand into ocean water that appears red-tinted in dawn light, [MAGNÃšS] 45 years old with brown beard carrying iron-pointed spear, boats arranged pointing toward whale spouts visible in distance.
Action: Men's boots sink into black sand as they push boats. Three boats, each 18 feet long, wooden, dark with age. Four men per boat. MagnÃºs leads first boat, carries 7-foot spear with iron point, shaft dark wood. Other men carry similar spears. They push boats into water. Water appears red - dawn light creating illusion of blood. Boats float immediately. Men climb over sides, water dripping from boots. Take positions at oars - two men per side. Begin rowing. All twelve men pull oars simultaneously. Each stroke moves boats 6 feet forward. Water parts around boat bows, red color intensifying where disturbed. In distance, whale spouts visible - water shooting up 30 feet, three locations, 500 yards away. Young boy [JÃ“N] stands on shore watching, too young for hunt.
Scene: Black sand beach, dawn. Ocean calm except for whale spouts. Red-tinted water from sun angle. Mountains behind beach. Women and children watching from shore.
Style: Wide shot from elevated position on beach showing boats entering water (that's where the camera is), seeing both boats and distant whales.
Dialogue: None
Sounds: [PRIMARY: Boats scraping sand, men climbing aboard, oars hitting water simultaneously] [AMBIENT: Whale spouts distant, water lapping shore] [ABSENT: talking, wind]
Technical (Negative Prompt): no subtitles, show red-tinted water, synchronized rowing, distant whale spouts, 1080p
Should I continue with more purely visual descriptions for VEO?RetryIThis is working well - keep on going, think deeply, take your time and feel free to ask questions about where we are going. Feel free to add a and b to split scenes if it makes them clearer. This is our opportunity to make a great movieEditMapped cinematic visual narrative strategy for VEO projectThe user wants me to continue with the visual descriptions for the VEO prompts. They're happy with the direction - pure visual descriptions rather than abstract concepts. I should continue with the next shots, focusing on:

The whale marking scene
The return and split (some men to cliffs, others prepare shore)
The egg collecting (sÃ­g) with father-son dynamics
The berry picking parallel
The visual rhyming between blood, egg yolk, and berry juice

I should keep in mind:

VEO needs concrete visual descriptions
Use a/b shot splits when scenes are complex
Build toward the feast and collapse
Connect to the main story's themes (transformation, counting, colonial pressure)
The three liquids (blood, berry juice, egg yolk) as visual prophecy

Let me continue with shots 1b through 3, maintaining the pure visual approach.
