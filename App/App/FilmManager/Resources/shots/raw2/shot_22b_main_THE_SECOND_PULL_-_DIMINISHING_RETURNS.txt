SHOT 22b: THE SECOND PULL - DIMINISHING RETURNS
Progressive State: House 10/min + 50bpm | Strength fading | Camera frost 13.5% | Cost accumulating | Watching: Cane standing alone
Women's Silence: Window now empty
Triple Reality: Physical: bleeding and aging / Psychological: borrowed time / Mythological: gods demand payment
[STITCH from Shot 22: First supernatural pull, blood on beard]

Subject: [MAGNÃšS] attempting second pull, waiting for trawler beam to return, but when yellow light hits again the aflausn is weaker - only 10 feet this time - and the cost higher: blood from ears now, a tooth loosening in his mouth, his hair visibly greying in the beam.

Action: MagnÃºs wipes frozen blood from nose, positions for second pull. Counts trawler rotation: 18... 19... 20 seconds. Light coming. Grips rope, prepared. Beam hits - aflausn returns but diminished. Pulls with supernatural strength but boat only moves 10 feet. Cost immediate: blood from both ears, running down neck, freezing. Spits - blood and a molar, white against red snow. In trawler light, his hair literally greys, brown becoming silver in real-time. Hands shake worse - 5Hz constant now, can barely grip rope. Behind him, his abandoned cane has grown ice roots, 6 inches into ground, becoming permanent. Through window - empty. Family no longer watching, or cannot watch. Only empty clothes remain at glass, breath fogging from inside at 8/min. Realizes pattern: each pull costs more, gives less. Still 150 meters to fjord. At this rate, will be dead before water.

Scene: 30 feet from house now, following blood spirals. Temperature -25Â°C, his body heat dropping. Where blood falls, steam rises then freezes. The cane behind like grave marker, ice roots spreading. Sun trying to rise but clouds building - storm coming. Trawler beam the only reliable light.

Style: Close on transformation in beam, showing real-time aging (that's where the camera is), documentary of payment due.

Dialogue: (Counting): "ÃtjÃ¡n... nÃ­tjÃ¡n... tuttugu..." (Spitting tooth): "TÃ¶nn lÃ­ka?" (Teeth too?) (To distant fjord): "ÃžrjÃ¡r manneskjur... Ã©g er ein" (Three men... I am one)

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Second drag shorter, blood from ears, tooth hitting snow, hair greying audible as crystalline sound] [AMBIENT: Tremor 5Hz constant, cane creaking as ice roots spread, storm building] [ABSENT: no family witness, no divine intervention]

Technical (Negative Prompt): no subtitles, show aging in beam clearly, accumulating cost, documentary observation
