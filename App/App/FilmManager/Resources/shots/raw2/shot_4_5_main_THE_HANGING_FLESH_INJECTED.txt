SHOT 4.5: THE HANGING FLESH (INJECTED)
Progressive State: House 12/min | KlettagjÃ¡ invisible | Pre-contamination | Camera frost 2% | Watching: cosmos through smoke hole
Women's Silence: Morning stillness
Triple Reality: Physical: hÃ¡karl source / Psychological: what feeds them / Mythological: sacrifice already present
[STITCH from Shot 4: Camera approaching smoke hole]

Subject: As the camera descends through the smoke hole, it passes the massive Greenland shark carcass hanging from the central beam - 8 feet long, partially butchered, skin grey-black like industrial rubber, flesh beneath showing the 13-day fermentation line where grey-green meets fresh pink, drops of ammonia-rich liquid falling into wooden bucket below, the entire house built around this hanging flesh.

Action: Camera descends past the shark, revealing it's been here throughout. Suspended by rope through its tail, the carcass rotates slowly in house breathing drafts. The fermentation line visible - upper portion grey-green and jellied (13 days fermented), lower portion still pink but beginning to turn. Black contamination fibers run through the meat like veins, pulsing faintly. Where rope meets beam, tar has leaked down, mixing with shark fluids. The bucket below nearly full of greenish liquid - ammoniac urine and decomposition. Flies should be present but aren't - too cold, or already eaten. The shark's eye, clouded white, seems to track the camera's descent. In its mouth, visible rows of teeth, but mixed among them - what might be human molars. The family below positions themselves to avoid drips, unconscious geography shaped by hanging meat.

Scene: Smoke hole interior, 5:30 AM, pre-dawn darkness. Temperature -25Â°C outside, -8Â°C inside. The shark dominates vertical space, family must duck around it. Fermentation smell overwhelming but family doesn't react - normalized. The rope creaks with house breathing, shark swaying. Central beam (giant's rib) bowed from weight, showing this has hung here for generations.

Style: Vertical descent shot passing shark, camera movement through smoke hole (that's where the camera is), revealing shark as architectural element.

Dialogue: None - just house breathing and rope creaking

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Rope creaking, ammonia drops hitting bucket, house breathing causing sway] [AMBIENT: Fermentation bubbling in flesh, tar dripping, no flies] [ABSENT: no disgust, no acknowledgment]

Technical (Negative Prompt): no subtitles, no text overlays, show contamination in meat, documentary observation
