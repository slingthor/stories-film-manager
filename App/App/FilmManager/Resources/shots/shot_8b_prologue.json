Guðrún next - purple juice on chin appears black like dried blood. Sigrid's face calm, eyes ancient, knowing something. Jón's small face, golden egg yolk on cheek now black mark. Lilja clutching cloth doll, purple mouth open showing black teeth. Move to other families. Every face has animal eye-shine in the light. The three stains make patterns on skin - blood, berry, egg - forming shapes like markings. One man's stains form perfect sheep face on his cheek. Woman's stains make horn shapes on forehead. Children all have black mouths from juice, look like they've eaten darkness. Everyone perfectly still, no one blinks despite bright light. Breathing synchronized. The searchlight flickers once - in that moment, everyone appears as sheep faces. Flickers back - human again.",
