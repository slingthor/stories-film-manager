      "subject": "[SIGRID] 16 years old with wheat-blonde hair in white linen dress standing beside the pole, opening her mouth to sing, lips moving to form Icelandic words, but deep male voice emerges while her eyes look directly at camera.",
      "action": "Sigrid stands 3 feet from pole, perfectly still. White dress hangs straight down - no wind. She opens mouth, lips form the words 'Krummi svaf \u00ed klettagj\u00e1.' Deep male voice emerges from her throat - bass tone, elderly sound. Her lips continue moving, perfectly forming each syllable. Eyes never leave camera lens. Behind her, three whale spouts rise from ocean - water shoots up 20 feet. She continues singing, mouth moving: 'kaldri vetrarn\u00f3ttu \u00e1.' Frost forms on grass around her feet, spreading outward in circle, white crystals despite summer. Her right hand reaches out, touches pole. When hand pulls away, palm is stained - red thumb, purple fingers, gold wrist. She looks at stained hand while mouth continues moving, male voice continuing. Dress hem turns purple where it touches frosted grass.",
