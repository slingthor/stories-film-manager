      "subject": "A British steel trawler 200 feet long visible on horizon, black smoke from stack, powerful electric searchlight on bow swiveling toward shore, the beam of white light cutting through golden sunset toward the feast.",
      
      "action": "Trawler sits on horizon line, hull black steel, industrial design. Smoke rises from stack, black against golden sky, perfectly vertical - still no wind. Ship not moving, anchored. On bow, large searchlight mounted on swivel. Light off initially. Then clicks on - electric arc light, blue-white, impossibly bright. Beam shoots across water toward shore. Light cuts through golden sunset like blade. Sweeps left across empty beach. Sweeps right across cliffs. Stops. Reverses. Finds the feast tables. Light locks onto gathering. Holds steady. Everyone at tables turns toward light, faces washed white, shadows thrown behind them black and sharp. No one shields eyes. All stare directly into beam. The trawler's beam makes the three stains on everyone's clothes visible - red blood, purple juice, golden yolk - all appear black in the harsh light. Ship's horn doesn't sound. Just the light. Watching.",
