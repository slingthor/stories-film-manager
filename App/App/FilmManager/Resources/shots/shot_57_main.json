      "action": "Absolute darkness. No visual information. Only breathing patterns creating spatial awareness: MAGNÚS breathing at 8/min deep ram rhythm from table head position. GUÐRÚN breathing 8/min ewe rhythm from right side. SIGRID breathing 12/min raven preparation from 11-foot distance. JÓN breathing 20/min lamb rhythm from between parents. LILJA breathing 20/min simple lamb from mother's side. Each breathing pattern creates spatial positioning awareness - audience constructs family arrangement through respiratory geography. Breathing patterns occasionally sync then separate, creating natural polyrhythm. Through darkness, subtle wet sounds - what might be chewing, or might be something else. House breathing at 3/min dying rhythm underneath everything. Heartbeat stopped completely. In final seconds, match strike preparation - subtle cloth rustle, stone scraping flint.",
