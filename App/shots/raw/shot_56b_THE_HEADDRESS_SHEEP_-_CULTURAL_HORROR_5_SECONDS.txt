SHOT 56b: THE HEADDRESS SHEEP - CULTURAL HORROR (5 SECONDS)
Progressive State: Identity collapsed | Camera frost 48% | Culture perverted | Watching: We see blasphemy
Women's Silence: Sheep wearing women's identity
Triple Reality: Physical: ewe in headdress | Psychological: identity lost | Mythological: complete transformation
Duration: 5 seconds
Camera Movement: Slow push in on GuÃ°rÃºn-ewe
[STITCH from Shot 56a: MagnÃºs seeing sheep family]

Subject: Close-up pushing in on [GUÃRÃšN] as ewe wearing the faldbÃºningur headdress, the traditional Icelandic women's crown sitting absurdly on sheep head, white wool against white fabric, human dignity on animal form.

Action: SLOW PUSH IN on GuÃ°rÃºn-ewe's head. FaldbÃºningur headdress - symbol of Icelandic womanhood, marriages, tradition - perched on sheep skull. Too wide for human head shape. Sliding forward over horizontal eyes. She tries to adjust it with hooves, can't. The white fabric against white wool makes her almost invisible - just eyes and headdress floating. Push closer: human teeth visible when she opens mouth to breathe. Dental work still there - one silver filling catching light. The ultimate perversion: cultural identity on livestock. She breathes at 11/min - the synchronized rate. Still controlled. Still administered. Danish colonialism made them animals wearing human costume. Now costume doesn't fit. Never did.

Scene: Close on ewe head with headdress. Cultural symbol on animal. Identity collapsed.

Style: Push in on perverted identity (that's where the camera is), cultural horror documented.

Dialogue: None - just breathing through wrong throat

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Headdress sliding on wool, sheep breathing, fabric against fleece] [AMBIENT: House dying gasps, synchronized breathing] [ABSENT: no words possible]
