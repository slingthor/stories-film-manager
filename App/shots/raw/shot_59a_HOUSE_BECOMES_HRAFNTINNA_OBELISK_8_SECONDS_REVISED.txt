SHOT 59a: HOUSE BECOMES HRAFNTINNA OBELISK (8 SECONDS) [REVISED]
Progressive State: Structure transforming | Camera frost 52% | Monolith emerging | Watching: Architecture ascending
Women's Silence: Silent before transformation
Triple Reality: Physical: house to obsidian | Psychological: witness monument | Mythological: klettagjÃ¡ as obelisk
Duration: 8 seconds
Camera Movement: Crane back revealing transformation
[STITCH from Shot 58c: Sigrid's transformation beginning]

Subject: The house suddenly crystallizing into black hrafntinna (obsidian), walls becoming smooth volcanic glass, the entire structure rising and narrowing into a 30-foot OBELISK with a vertical cleft running through it - the klettagjÃ¡ IS the monolith, black as raven feathers.

Action: CRANE BACK rapidly as house transforms. Walls darken - wood and stone becoming volcanic glass. Hrafntinna. Raven flint. The black obsidian sacred to Iceland. Structure doesn't collapse - CRYSTALLIZES. Rising. Narrowing. Becoming geometric. Perfect. Monolithic. 30 feet tall. 8 feet wide at base. 4 feet at top. Classic obelisk proportions. But through center: vertical CLEFT. Not crack - designed opening. The klettagjÃ¡ from lullaby. Rocky cleft IS the monument. Surface reflects everything but wrong - shows ravens where sheep stand, shows sky where ground is. The third monolith isn't a raven. It's the transformed house. The witness monument. Inside: sheep family trapped in crystal. Visible through translucent obsidian. Suspended. Preserved. Except Sigrid - she stands at cleft opening. The only way out is through. Black feathers against black stone. Almost invisible except for movement.

Scene: House becoming massive black obelisk. Hrafntinna formation. Vertical cleft visible. Family trapped inside.

Style: Crane back showing monumental transformation (that's where the camera is), architecture transcending.

Dialogue: None - awe silence

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Crystallization sound like ice forming, stone rising, glass singing] [AMBIENT: Wind through cleft making flute sounds, obsidian resonating] [ABSENT: no organic sounds]
