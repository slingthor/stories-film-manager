SHOT 13: RAVEN AT WINDOW - FIRST MONOLITH
Progressive State: House 10/min â†’ 13/min | KlettagjÃ¡ 2mm | Monolith arrival | Camera frost 8% | Reality crack | Watching: Raven watching back
Women's Silence: All silent before presence
Triple Reality: Physical: bird at window / Psychological: death omen / Mythological: Gammur checking
[STITCH from Shot 12: Dark movement outside window during lullaby]
Subject: A raven landing at the frosted window with unnatural precision, absolutely still like black geometry against white frost, but in the window's reflection the family count is wrong - showing six clear figures at table though only five exist, and in the raven's eye, a reflection of five sheep wearing the family's clothes.
Action: The raven lands with no sound. Not normal bird behavior - perfectly still, wings folded in exact symmetry. Through 4mm interior frost, its form is geometric, monolithic. Family freezes seeing it. 12-second hold: no movement from raven, family, even house breathing pauses. But in window glass reflection beside raven: six people clearly visible at table, sixth figure solid, wearing MagnÃºs's spare sweater. And in the raven's black eye (impossible close-up through distance): reflection shows the family but AS SHEEP - five sheep in their clothes, sitting at table, human teeth visible in sheep mouths. MagnÃºs raises hand to shoo it - raven doesn't flinch. Finally turns head exactly 90 degrees, looks directly at Sigrid, blinks once (vertical eyelid), flies away. Leaves perfect wing-print in frost - cross pattern with sixth feather that shouldn't exist. Family unfreezes, resumes activity, but mathematics broken. House breathing resumes at 13/min, agitated.
Scene: South window, 6:08 AM, grey light through frost. Temperature drops 2 degrees while raven present: -12Â°C. Window frost 4mm thick with cross patterns, raven's presence adding new geometry. The reflection showing impossible count. Wing-print left behind becomes part of frost patterns.
Style: Static shot on window, then zoom to raven's eye reflection (that's where the camera is), documentary of impossible observation.
Dialogue: Complete silence for 12 seconds
(After raven leaves, MagnÃºs): "Hrafn..." (Tone: naming fear)
(Sigrid, whispered): "Hann sÃ¡ okkur" (He saw us)
Sounds: [PRIMARY: Complete silence during hold, wing-print forming in frost, house breathing resuming] [AMBIENT: Family breathing held then resuming, heartbeat continues 60bpm throughout] [ABSENT: no bird sounds, no normal raven behavior]
Technical (Negative Prompt): no subtitles, no movement during 12-second hold, show reflection count wrong, eye reflection clear
