SHOT 23: SIGRID'S INCANTATION BEGINS
Progressive State: House 8/min + 50bpm slowing | Tilberi ritual | Camera frost 14% | Voice changing | Watching: House listening
Women's Silence: BROKEN - MagnÃºs gone, Sigrid speaks
Triple Reality: Physical: desperate ritual / Psychological: teenage mother / Mythological: summoning beginning
[STITCH from Shot 22b: MagnÃºs struggling outside, Sigrid prepared inside]

Subject: [SIGRID] kneeling over the contaminated materials, her 16-year-old voice beginning the tilberi incantation she memorized from grandmother's book, speaking aloud for first time since MagnÃºs left - but industrial rope already resisting, trying to coil away from the sheep rib as her voice involuntarily deepens with each word.

Action: Sigrid holds sheep rib in left hand, industrial rope in right. Book open beside her, pages yellowed, some words in Danish replacing Old Norse - corruption even in text. Begins winding rope around bone: "Tilberi, tilberi, Ã¾Ãº skalt mjÃ³lka fyrir mig" (Tilberi, you shall milk for me). Her young voice clear at first - MagnÃºs gone, she can speak. But rope fights back, tar making her fingers stick, hemp trying to coil opposite direction. Forces it. Voice drops half octave: "ÃžÃº skalt nÃ¦ra barniÃ°" (You shall nourish the child). Hand moves to belly, protective. Baby's heartbeat accelerates - 140 to 150bpm, sensing danger. GuÃ°rÃºn watches from corner, mouth opening and closing like fish, wanting to warn but women's training too strong. Pricks finger with brass button for blood offering - but button goes too deep, industrial sharp, blood flows too freely. Voice drops full octave: "Komdu til mÃ­n" (Come to me). House breathing slows more - 6/min. Through window, trawler beam shows MagnÃºs collapsed in snow, paying aflausn cost.

Scene: Interior, 6:35 AM, trawler light every 20 seconds illuminating ritual. Temperature -15Â°C, Sigrid's breath visible, mixing with steam from her blood. Materials fighting fusion - rope growing INTO bone against nature, brass button opening like eye. On floor, her blood forms pattern - but not tilberi pattern. Ram circles. Five spirals with six intersections, matching outside. Blood knows what's coming.

Style: Close on hands and materials, showing contamination fighting (that's where the camera is), documentary of corruption spreading.

Dialogue: (Sigrid, voice deepening): "Tilberi, tilberi, Ã¾Ãº skalt mjÃ³lka fyrir mig" (Half octave lower): "ÃžÃº skalt nÃ¦ra barniÃ° mitt" (Full octave lower): "Komdu til... nei, Ã¾etta er vitlaust" (Realizing): "RÃ¶dd... Ã¾etta er ekki mÃ­n rÃ¶dd"

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Young voice becoming deep, rope fighting bone, blood dripping forming circles] [AMBIENT: Baby heartbeat 150bpm, house breathing 6/min, GuÃ°rÃºn's silent fish-mouth gasping] [ABSENT: no stopping possible, corruption spreading]

Technical (Negative Prompt): no subtitles, show voice change gradually, blood patterns forming, documentary observation
