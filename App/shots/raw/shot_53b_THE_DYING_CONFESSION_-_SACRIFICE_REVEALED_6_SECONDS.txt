[STITCH from Shot 53a: "Ã‰G ER BERGRISI" revealed]

Subject: The house continuing its confession through grinding stone and creaking wood: "Ã‰g dey... fyrir ykkur... til aÃ° Ã¾iÃ° getiÃ° breyst" (I die... for you... so you can transform), revealing the giant's death enables their metamorphosis.

Action: PUSH THROUGH vibrating space toward center. House speaks through materials: stone foundation grinding forms "Ã‰G DEY," wood beams creaking spell "FYRIR YKKUR," turf walls breathing whisper "TIL AÃ ÃžIÃ GETIÃ BREYST." The giant is dying so they can transform - death enabling metamorphosis. Floor shows veins now - red lines pulsing beneath earth, blood vessels visible. Heartbeat dropping: 70bpm... 60... 50. Breathing more labored: 6/min... 5... 4. With each word, house ages visibly - new cracks spreading, moss falling, stones loosening. The family understands: they're in dying god's body. Their transformation requires his death. Sigrid touches wall, feels pulse weakening. Her hand comes away wet - wall perspiration mixed with blood. The house loves her specifically, dying to free her.

Scene: Interior becoming obviously body cavity. Deterioration visible. Giant's sacrifice manifesting.

Style: Push through speaking architecture (that's where the camera is), sacrifice documented.

Dialogue: (House, through materials): "Ã‰g dey... fyrir ykkur..." "Til aÃ° Ã¾iÃ° getiÃ° breyst" (Sigrid, understanding): "ÃžÃº ert aÃ° gefa okkur leiÃ° Ãºt"

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Stone grinding words, wood creaking speech, turf breathing whispers] [AMBIENT: Heartbeat slowing, breathing laboring, house aging] [ABSENT: human voices overwhelmed]
