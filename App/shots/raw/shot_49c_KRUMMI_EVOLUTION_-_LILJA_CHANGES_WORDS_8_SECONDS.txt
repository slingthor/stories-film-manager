[STITCH from Shot 49b: House groaning warning, MagnÃºs oblivious]

Subject: [LILJA] suddenly singing the Krummi lullaby but words changing themselves - "Krummi svaf Ã­ klettagjÃ¡" becoming "SIGRID flÃ½gur Ãºr klettagjÃ¡" (Sigrid flies from rocky cleft), the house IS the cleft, and the child prophesying escape while [MAGNÃšS] turns, distracted from inspection.

Action: Lilja sits in rÃ©ttir position, begins singing. Voice clear, five-year-old pitch: "Krummi svaf Ã­ klettagjÃ¡..." But as ZOOM BEGINS, words change. Not deliberately - emerging differently: "Sigrid svaf Ã­ klettagjÃ¡..." MagnÃºs turns from Sigrid, listening. Lilja continues, words evolving: "Sigrid flÃ½gur Ãºr klettagjÃ¡" (Sigrid flies from rocky cleft). "VerÃ°ur margt aÃ° meini" (Much becomes harmful) stays same. "En hÃºn flÃ½gur, hÃºn mun lifa" (But she flies, she will live). The house IS the klettagjÃ¡ - rocky cleft from lullaby. Wall cracks deepening, becoming cleft-like. MagnÃºs approaches Lilja, confused by changed words. This breaks his focus on Sigrid. She slides along wall, reestablishing 11 feet distance. Lilja continues singing, eyes closed, prophetic trance: "Krummi kemur, Krummi sÃ©r" (Raven comes, Raven sees). "Sigrid verÃ°ur Krummi" (Sigrid becomes Raven). House breathing slows to match lullaby rhythm. Beams stop groaning. Everything listening to prophecy. Through window: actual raven lands on sill. Watching. Waiting.

Scene: Interior with Lilja central, all listening. Raven visible outside. Prophecy moment.

Style: Slow zoom on prophetic child (that's where the camera is), future speaking through innocence.

Dialogue: (Lilja, singing transformed): "Sigrid svaf Ã­ klettagjÃ¡" "Sigrid flÃ½gur Ãºr klettagjÃ¡" "En hÃºn flÃ½gur, hÃºn mun lifa" "Sigrid verÃ°ur Krummi"

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Child's voice changing words, lullaby rhythm, raven tap on window] [AMBIENT: House matching song rhythm, everyone breathing with melody] [ABSENT: no correction, prophecy accepted]

Visual Composition:

Zoom reveals: Child in trance
Words visible: Almost see them changing
Raven witness: Outside watching
Wall cleft: KlettagjÃ¡ forming
Escape path: Visible in cracks
Technical (Negative Prompt): maintain zoom, show word evolution, raven visible
