[STITCH from Shot 24a: "HJÃLPIÃ OKKUR" echoing]

Subject: From the east, the trawler GRIMSBY PRIDE's horn blasting with impossible volume - not ship's horn but serpent's roar - the sound physical, visible as pressure wave racing across water, shattering the already-cracked window, revealing yellow searchlights sweeping frantically like searching eyes.

Action: The instant "HJÃLPIÃ OKKUR" completes, response from east. Trawler horn but wrong - too loud, too long, too alive. Sound visible as pressure wave across fjord, flattening grass, bending fence posts. Hits house: CRACK. Window shatters inward, not from impact but from frequency. Glass shards hang in air for moment, rotating, catching trawler's yellow light, before falling. Through broken window, trawler visible but wrong - hull undulating, smokestacks breathing black clouds in rhythm, searchlights sweeping frantically not mechanically. The lights find the house, lock on, two yellow beams like eyes focusing. Horn continues: 8 full seconds, brown note, bowel-loosening frequency. Sigrid's nose starts bleeding from pressure. Children's ears bleeding. GuÃ°rÃºn vomits from frequency. But horn also sounds hurt - metallic scream mixed with organic pain. Industrial contamination in the serpent's voice. It's answering but wounded.

Scene: Eastern window exploding. Trawler visible in fjord, moving wrong. Yellow lights fixed on house. Distance collapsing - trawler seems closer than possible.

Style: From inside looking out through shattering window, trawler revealed (that's where the camera is), documentary of eastern response.

Dialogue: (Horn): Eight seconds of impossible sound (Family): Wordless reactions to pressure (Blood from ears): Dripping audible under horn
