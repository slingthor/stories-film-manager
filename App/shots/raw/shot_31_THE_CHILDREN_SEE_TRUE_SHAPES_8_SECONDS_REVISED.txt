Subject: [JÃ“N] and [LILJA] huddled together on sleeping platform, the boy's 39Â°C fever allowing him to see everyone's true shapes - pointing at each family member and counting sheep not people: "Ein kind, tvÃ¦r kindur, Ã¾rjÃ¡r..." while Lilja arranges her doll family in rÃ©ttir formation, the floor's worn patterns now clearly visible as ancient sorting pens.

Action: JÃ³n's fever breaks him through reality's veil. Points at GuÃ°rÃºn: "Ein kind" (one sheep). At empty clothes: "TvÃ¦r kindur" (two sheep). At Sigrid: "ÃžrjÃ¡r kindur" (three sheep). Counts what he SEES, not what's there. Lilja, following his lead, arranges her dolls on floor where rÃ©ttir patterns show clear - five pens radiating from center, but six intersection points. Places dolls as sheep being sorted. Her doll with brass button eyes placed in center - the forystufÃ©, lead wether that guides others to slaughter. Floor patterns deepening, revealing stone underneath packed earth - ancient rÃ©ttir were always here, house built on them. Through fever-bright eyes, JÃ³n sees more: everyone has two shadows - human and animal. Sigrid's shadow shows raven wings. GuÃ°rÃºn's shows ewe with faldbÃºningur. His own shows lamb, sick and stumbling. The shadows move independently, rehearsing transformation. Lilja hums Krummi tune: "verÃ°ur margt aÃ° meini" (much becomes harmful) - understanding the prophecy.

Scene: Children's sleeping platform, 9:10 AM dark. Temperature -23Â°C. Floor patterns visible as ancient stone rÃ©ttir beneath earth. Everyone's dual shadows visible in landvÃ¦ttir light from windows.

Style: Child's eye level showing dual realities overlapping (that's where the camera is), documentary of innocent revelation.

Dialogue: (JÃ³n, fevered counting): "Ein kind, tvÃ¦r kindur, Ã¾rjÃ¡r, fjÃ³rar, fimm... sex?" (Pointing at empty space): "SjÃ¶tta kindin" (The sixth sheep) (Lilja, humming): "VerÃ°ur margt aÃ° meini..."

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Children's voices seeing truth, dolls placed in pattern, Krummi melody hummed] [AMBIENT: Dual shadows moving independently, stone rÃ©ttir revealing through floor, house 4/min dying] [ABSENT: no adult understanding, no correction]

Technical (Negative Prompt): no subtitles, show dual shadows clearly, rÃ©ttir patterns in floor, documentary observation
