      "action": "Door stands open (who opened it?). ZOOM OUT reveals threshold. There: GriÃ°ungur. Massive bull, 6-foot head, body blocking entire doorway. Same contamination - brass harpoons through skull, rope beneath skin, net fused with eyes. But HERE. At house. Impossible. He was dying on shore, too massive to move. No tracks in snow. No path. Just HERE. Green verdigris tears still flowing from metal infections, pooling at doorstep. Still breathing - 3/min, matching house's dying rhythm. Eyes ancient, watching family. But family not surprised. GuÃ°rÃºn steps toward door with empty water bucket. Steps OVER him. One foot on his neck, other on ground beyond. Casual. Daily. Like stepping over sleeping dog. MagnÃºs (feet somehow free from floor) follows. Steps on Bull's horn for leverage. Children next. Only Sigrid pauses, kneels, touches his massive head. Whispers: \"ÃžÃº ert hÃ©r til aÃ° sjÃ¡\" (You're here to see). He blinks. Understands. Came to witness transformation.",
