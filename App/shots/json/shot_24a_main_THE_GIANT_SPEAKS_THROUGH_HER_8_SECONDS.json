      "action": "Sigrid's mouth opens wider than should be possible. The word completes: \"LANDVÃ†TTIR\" but not from her throat. From walls - turf vibrating. From floor - packed earth speaking. From beams - giant's ribs resonating. 16Hz below hearing, felt in bones, teeth, eyes. Her body rigid, back arched, hands spread, conduit not source. \"KOMIÃ\" emerges from everywhere. Dust cascades from ceiling with each syllable. The three beams (ribs) flex visibly, showing pink tissue beneath wood for split second. Windows vibrate in frames, frost cracking off in sheets. GuÃ°rÃºn crawls backward, mouth open in silent scream. Children grip each other, JÃ³n's fever breaking in sudden sweat, Lilja's eyes rolled back showing whites. Empty clothes standing fully upright, breathing matching house rhythm. Sigrid's eyes remain conscious, terrified - she's aware but not in control. Baby's heartbeat visible as red strobe through dress: 160bpm.",
