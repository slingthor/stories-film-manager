      "action": "CLOSE ON FLOOR - packed earth becomes translucent like ice. Through it: stone structures below. CRANE UP slowly revealing full pattern. Ancient rÃ©ttir, the circular stone sorting pens, but 10 feet down - impossible, house is on ground level. Five stone pens radiating from center, sixth pen different - newer, Danish construction. In the pens: sheep. But wearing clothes. Ram with MagnÃºs's sweater. Ewe with GuÃ°rÃºn's faldbÃºningur. Lambs with children's dresses. Fifth pen: young ewe with subtle belly, Sigrid's dress. Sixth pen: enormous raven, watching up through floor. The sheep below move when family above moves - synchronized. Or is family moving because sheep move? Which controls which? MagnÃºs drops to knees, pressing hands to floor: \"HvaÃ° er fyrir neÃ°an?\" Through transparent section, the ram below presses hooves up. They touch through impossible space. Below the rÃ©ttir: glimpse of pink flesh, rhythmic pulsing. They're in Bergrisi's stomach. The rÃ©ttir are his digestive system. The house is his mouth.",
