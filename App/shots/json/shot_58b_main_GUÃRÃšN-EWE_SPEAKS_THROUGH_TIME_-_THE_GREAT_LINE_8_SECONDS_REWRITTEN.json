      "action": "360Â° ROTATION around GuÃ°rÃºn-ewe. She stands, understanding flooding her horizontal pupils. As camera circles, walls show different times. First quarter: 1888, them as sheep. Second quarter: 1944, Sigrid aged 72 watching Iceland become independent. Third quarter: 2024, tourists at black monument taking photos. Fourth quarter: return to now. Through ALL times, her voice echoes: \"ViÃ° deyjum sem kindur...\" The words exist across centuries. In 1944, old Sigrid hears them. In 2024, children on school trips hear them. \"Til aÃ° bÃ¶rn okkar...\" Looking at lamb-children who will have human children. The cycle. The sacrifice. \"Geti orÃ°iÃ° fÃ³lk.\" The final word FÃ“LK reverberates through time. Creates cracks in crystallizing walls. The truth so powerful it shapes the monument. Where her words touch walls, they become clearest glass. Windows through time. Portals of memory.",
