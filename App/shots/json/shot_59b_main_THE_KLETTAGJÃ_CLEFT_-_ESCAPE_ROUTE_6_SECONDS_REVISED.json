Not dead - preserved. MagnÃºs-ram with horns against glass. GuÃ°rÃºn-ewe with faldbÃºningur frozen mid-adjust. Lamb-children huddled. All suspended in black crystal. Museum pieces. Memory preserved. The passage narrow - 18 inches wide. Human could barely squeeze. Sheep cannot fit. Only something that could fly. Through glass: their eyes still aware. Watching Sigrid. Understanding. They're the monument now. The witness stone. Future generations will see them. Remember. Learn. The cleft leads up. Toward sky. Toward escape. Light at top.
