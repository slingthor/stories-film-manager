Human teeth visible - baby teeth in front, adult teeth emerging behind. Human dental pattern in sheep jaw. Tongue human-pink, not sheep-grey. Trying to form words. Cut to Lilja-lamb: \"Maaaa-maaaa, Ã©g er hrÃ¦dd\" (Mommy, I'm scared). But only \"Maaaa\" emerges clearly. The horror: they're conscious. Know they're children. Trapped in sheep bodies. Or were always sheep thinking they were children? Both? GuÃ°rÃºn-ewe tries to comfort, nuzzles them with sheep snout. But tears from horizontal pupils. Human tears from sheep eyes. They huddle together. Three sheep in children's clothes. Family still family. Love still love. But wrong bodies. Or right bodies, wrong consciousness? Which is true?",
