      "action": "CAMERA STARTS at boat level as MagnÃºs wraps fin in cloth, places under bench like treasure. Grips oars with 0Hz hands. Begins to row. CAMERA CRANES UP, rising 20 meters in 3 seconds. As we rise, perspective reveals: His boat has carved a clear channel through poisoned water. Behind him, contamination. Ahead, still-clear path home. But poison spreading both ways, will meet in middle soon. From aerial height, boat tiny between two disasters - poisoned sea behind, something wrong at house ahead (black smoke, not grey). Ravens following in V-formation now, not spiral - migration pattern, leaving pattern. His rowing rhythm mechanical: stroke, stroke, stroke. No variation. Defeated automation.",
