      "action": "Children sit by hearth's last embers. JÃ³n raises hands to make shadow bird. But shadow shows ram's head - curved horns, long snout. Doesn't notice. Lilja makes butterfly with hands. Shadow shows ewe, faldbÃºningur shape on sheep head. They continue playing, shadows telling truth. PUSH IN on wall. Shadow play becomes elaborate: Five sheep in pen formation. Sixth shadow appears though only two children. The shadows begin moving independently - sheep shadows walking while hands stay still. Through shadows, glimpse of empty clothes standing behind children, also casting shadows. Now eight shadows for two children and clothes. Mathematical impossibility visible. In shadow: sheep have human teeth, visible when shadow-mouths open. JÃ³n's fever allows him to see: \"SjÃ¡Ã°u! ViÃ° erum Ã¾egar...\" (Look! We already are...). Lilja nods, continues playing. They know. Accept.",
