      "subject": "[SIGRID] kneeling before the contaminated materials, opening grandmother's forbidden book with trembling hands, her 16-year-old voice speaking aloud for the first time since MagnÃºs left - clear and high, like glass breaking: \"Ã‰g verÃ° aÃ° bjarga barninu\" (I must save the child).",
      "action": "Sigrid arranges materials in final pattern: sheep rib north-south, industrial rope coiled beside it, brass button at center, wool in handful. Opens book - pages yellow, some Danish replacing Old Norse, water damage making words swim. Her hand protective on belly, feeling movement - baby responding to mother's voice. Traces finger along first line of incantation. Takes breath, breaks her silence: \"Ã‰g verÃ° aÃ° bjarga barninu.\" Voice young, desperate, but clear. Years of enforced silence breaking like dam. GuÃ°rÃºn's head snaps up, shocked to hear daughter speak. Empty clothes lean forward. House breathing catches, holds at inhale. Through window, trawler beam passes, illuminating her face - determination and terror mixed. Book shows illustration: tilberi creature suckling, but margins have industrial additions - gears, pipes, contamination even in drawings.",
      "scene": "Interior, 6:35 AM, trawler light every 20 seconds. Temperature -15Â°C. Grandmother's corner with forbidden books, Christian crosses failing to hide pagan symbols underneath. Materials arranged but wrong - industrial mixing with organic.",
