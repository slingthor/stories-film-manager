      "action": "CRANE BACK rapidly as house transforms. Walls darken - wood and stone becoming volcanic glass. Hrafntinna. Raven flint. The black obsidian sacred to Iceland. Structure doesn't collapse - CRYSTALLIZES. Rising. Narrowing. Becoming geometric. Perfect. Monolithic. 30 feet tall. 8 feet wide at base. 4 feet at top. Classic obelisk proportions. But through center: vertical CLEFT. Not crack - designed opening. The klettagjÃ¡ from lullaby. Rocky cleft IS the monument. Surface reflects everything but wrong - shows ravens where sheep stand, shows sky where ground is. The third monolith isn't a raven. It's the transformed house. The witness monument. Inside: sheep family trapped in crystal. Visible through translucent obsidian. Suspended. Preserved. Except Sigrid - she stands at cleft opening. The only way out is through. Black feathers against black stone. Almost invisible except for movement.",
