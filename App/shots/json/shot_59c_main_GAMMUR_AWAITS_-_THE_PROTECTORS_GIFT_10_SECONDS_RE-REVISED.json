      "action": "CRANE UP as Sigrid emerges. At cleft top: GAMMUR. Not just any raven - THE raven. LandvÃ¦ttir. Protector. Ancient. Twice her size. Feathers containing stars. Eyes holding all Iceland's memories. The one who gave her the black feather. Who spoke prophecy. Who promised escape. \"Ã‰g kom eins og lofaÃ°\" - old woman's voice from massive bird. Gammur extends one wing. Touches Sigrid. At contact: final transformation. The human fully gone. Pure raven. Pure witness. But more - Gammur's touch transfers memory. All of Iceland's history flows into her. She KNOWS now. Everything. The sacrifice's meaning. The freedom coming. Her role. Gammur speaks again: \"ÃžÃº ert Ãsland. FlÃºgÃ°u fyrir okkur.\" (You are Iceland. Fly for us.) The seven ravens are Gammur's witnesses. But Gammur is oldest. Was here before Vikings. Will be here after independence. The eternal watcher who chose Sigrid for escape. The obelisk responds to Gammur - sends black light beam up. The landvÃ¦ttir and monument recognizing each other. Old gods and new forms. Bergrisi reborn as stone. Gammur eternal as sky. Sigrid between them - the bridge.",
