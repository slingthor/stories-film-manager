Shadow crumples to knees. Children's shadows haven't moved - JÃ³n and Lilja trained not to see, not to react. This is Tuesday, Thursday, any day. No neighbors to hear. No law to intervene. 40 miles of winter sea to any help. Third strike coming but GuÃ°rÃºn shadow raises hand - not to block but gesture of acceptance, submission. Cane shadow pauses. Through this, tilberi's actual form visible in corner of frame - watching, learning, brass eye unblinking. Recording how power works. House groans - 3/min breathing labored. Even the dying giant cannot intervene.",
