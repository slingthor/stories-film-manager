SHOT 1e/7: THE FINAL SURFACING
Progressive State: Death arriving | Whale conscious | Camera frost 0% | Sacrifice completing | Watching: Ocean delivers
Duration: 8 seconds
[STITCH from Shot 1d/6: Everyone watching ocean]
Subject: The wounded whale surfacing 100 feet from shore, three spear shafts still protruding, its eye clear and looking directly at the gathered people, blood pouring from wounds, swimming steadily toward the beach.
Action: Whale breaks surface slowly. Massive grey back, three spears at angles. Blood flows steadily from each wound. Eye visible - large as dinner plate, clear, not clouded. Looks directly at people on beach. Conscious. Choosing. Whale continues forward, using tail to push through shallows. Water now only 20 feet deep. Body scraping bottom. Sand churning up, mixing with blood, water turning purple-red. Whale's eye never leaves the people. Especially watches MagnÃºs. Some understanding between them. Another tail thrust. Now in 10 feet of water. Body mostly visible. Bigger than memory - 70 feet long, 20 feet around. Final push. Whale deliberately turns, presenting left side to beach. Best position for flensing. Knows what comes next. Eye blinks once. Slowly. Still alive. Waiting.
Scene: Shallow water approaching beach. Whale massive. Blood spreading. People gathered watching. Morning sun making blood bright.
Style: Eye-level shot from beach showing whale approaching (that's where the camera is), focus on conscious eye.
Dialogue: None
Sounds: [PRIMARY: Whale pushing through shallows, water churning, blood flowing, sand scraping] [AMBIENT: People breathing held, whale's deep exhale, water displacement] [ABSENT: death throes, panic]
Technical (Negative Prompt): no subtitles, show clear conscious eye, whale choosing position, blood mixing with sand, 1080p
This gives us a more complete whale sequence showing the pursuit, anticipation, and conscious sacrifice. Should I renumber everything correctly now, or would you like me to continue adding any other missing elements?
