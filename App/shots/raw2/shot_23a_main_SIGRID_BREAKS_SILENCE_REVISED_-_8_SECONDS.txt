[STITCH from Shot 22b: MagnÃºs collapsed outside]

Subject: [SIGRID] kneeling before the contaminated materials, opening grandmother's forbidden book with trembling hands, her 16-year-old voice speaking aloud for the first time since MagnÃºs left - clear and high, like glass breaking: "Ã‰g verÃ° aÃ° bjarga barninu" (I must save the child).

Action: Sigrid arranges materials in final pattern: sheep rib north-south, industrial rope coiled beside it, brass button at center, wool in handful. Opens book - pages yellow, some Danish replacing Old Norse, water damage making words swim. Her hand protective on belly, feeling movement - baby responding to mother's voice. Traces finger along first line of incantation. Takes breath, breaks her silence: "Ã‰g verÃ° aÃ° bjarga barninu." Voice young, desperate, but clear. Years of enforced silence breaking like dam. GuÃ°rÃºn's head snaps up, shocked to hear daughter speak. Empty clothes lean forward. House breathing catches, holds at inhale. Through window, trawler beam passes, illuminating her face - determination and terror mixed. Book shows illustration: tilberi creature suckling, but margins have industrial additions - gears, pipes, contamination even in drawings.

Scene: Interior, 6:35 AM, trawler light every 20 seconds. Temperature -15Â°C. Grandmother's corner with forbidden books, Christian crosses failing to hide pagan symbols underneath. Materials arranged but wrong - industrial mixing with organic.

Style: Close on Sigrid's face as silence breaks, pull back to show materials (that's where the camera is), documentary of threshold moment.

Dialogue: (Sigrid, breaking silence): "Ã‰g verÃ° aÃ° bjarga barninu" (Reading): "Tilberi, tilberi..." (GuÃ°rÃºn, shocked): Sharp inhale, no words

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Pages turning, young voice clear, materials being positioned] [AMBIENT: House holding breath at 8/min, baby heartbeat 140bpm, trawler beam passing] [ABSENT: no male authority, freedom to speak]
