SHOT 7a: THE FEAST ASSEMBLY
Progressive State: Abundance gathered | Tables set | Camera frost 0% | Paradise peak | Watching: The last plenty
Duration: 8 seconds
[STITCH from Shot 6b: Sheep sorted, evening approaching]
Subject: Three long driftwood tables arranged in horseshoe shape in field, laden with whale meat, dried fish, berry juice in jugs, boiled eggs, bread, the tables bending slightly under weight, fifty people taking seats.
Action: Tables covered with white cloth - where did cloth come from? Food arranged in patterns. Whale meat in center, still steaming. Dried fish in pyramids. Purple juice in clay jugs, liquid glowing slightly in evening light. Eggs boiled, shells removed, golden yolks visible. Fresh bread - impossible, no one baked today. Tables bend in middle from weight. People approach from all directions. Still wearing work clothes stained with three colors. Children's mouths still black from juice. Take seats in specific order - families together but pattern emerges. From above, people arranged like spokes of wheel. MagnÃºs at head of center table. GuÃ°rÃºn to his right. Sigrid to his left - honor position. JÃ³n beside mother. Lilja on bench end. Everyone sits simultaneously. No signal given. All faces turn toward MagnÃºs. Waiting. Sun low on horizon but not moving. Stuck again.
Scene: Field near houses. Three tables in horseshoe. Evening light golden. Ocean visible in distance. Mountains surrounding.
Style: High angle showing table arrangement and people positioning (that's where the camera is), formal composition, symmetrical.
Dialogue: None
Sounds: [PRIMARY: Benches scraping, cloth rustling, food steaming, people sitting simultaneously] [AMBIENT: Ocean distant, no wind, everyone breathing together] [ABSENT: conversation, nature sounds]
Technical (Negative Prompt): no subtitles, show horseshoe table shape, three-color stains on everyone, abundance bending tables, 1080p
Should I continue with the feast moment, the trawler's appearance, and the collapse into winter?RetryIcontinue - did you maybe skip scenes? Did you get confused when you used a, b and took that as if a and b counted as scenes?EditRecalculated scene count, correcting previous numbering misunderstanding.You're right - I was treating a/b as subdivisions but they should still count toward the 23 total scenes. Let me recalculate:
So far I've written:

Shot 0a, 0b (opening - not counted toward 23)
Shot 1a, 1b (count as shots 1-2)
Shot 2a, 2b (count as shots 3-4)
Shot 3a, 3b (count as shots 5-6)
Shot 4a, 4b (count as shots 7-8)
Shot 5a, 5b (count as shots 9-10)
Shot 6a, 6b (count as shots 11-12)
Shot 7a (count as shot 13)

So I'm at shot 13 of 23, with 10 shots remaining for:

The feast continuing
The trawler appearance
The collapse/transition to winter

Let me continue with proper numbering.You're right - I was treating a/b as subdivisions, but they should count toward the 23 total. I'm at shot 13 now (7a), with 10 shots remaining for the feast, trawler appearance, and collapse.
