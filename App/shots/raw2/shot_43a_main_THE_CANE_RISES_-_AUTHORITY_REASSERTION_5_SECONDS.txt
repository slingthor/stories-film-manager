[STITCH from Shot 42c: His authority undermined, rage building]

Subject: [MAGNÃšS] retrieving his cane from where it stands frozen in the floor by the door, the ice having grown roots 3 inches deep which crack as he wrenches it free, raising it not for walking but as weapon, the 0Hz stillness in his hands making it perfectly steady for the first time.

Action: MagnÃºs moves to door where cane stands. Ice has grown up shaft and DOWN into floor - rooted like frozen tree. Grips with 0Hz hands (no tremor, no feeling). Wrenches. Ice CRACKS, floor splinters pulling up. Cane free but floor damaged - hole showing stone rÃ©ttir beneath. Turns to GuÃ°rÃºn. Raises cane overhead. The 0Hz stillness terrifying - no shake, no tremor, perfect control for violence. Low angle shows him massive, ceiling forcing him to hunch making him more bestial. 40 miles to nearest human. No one to stop this. No one to define this as wrong. Isolation has made him god and animal both. His white hair wild, eyes showing the madness of endless sameness - same walls, same faces, same failure, day after day, winter after winter. The cane perfectly still in air. GuÃ°rÃºn doesn't flinch - this is known, repeated, normal.

Scene: Interior, 9:45 AM. Door behind him showing storm. Cane raised against low ceiling. Family frozen in positions.

Style: Low angle tracking cane from floor to raised position (that's where the camera is), authority as violence.

Dialogue: (MagnÃºs, to cane): "Komdu Ã¾Ã¡" (To GuÃ°rÃºn): "ÃžÃš GERÃIR ÃžETTA"

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Ice cracking, floor splintering, cane whooshing up] [AMBIENT: 0Hz silence where tremor was, storm outside, family holding breath] [ABSENT: no intervention possible]
