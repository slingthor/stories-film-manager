      "subject": "[MAGNÚS] beginning the Danish counting while simultaneously distributing hákarl, his tremoring hand (3.5Hz) pointing at each family member with a piece of the grey-green fermented shark, the counting and poisoning revealed as the same act - administrative violence IS physical poisoning.",
      
      "action": "Magnús shifts to Danish, voice becoming mechanical, administrative. Points at Guðrún with first piece of hákarl: 'En' (One). She takes it, puts in mouth immediately, begins chewing. The meat is 13 days into 90-day fermentation - visible green spots, ammonia vapor rising. Points at Jón with second piece: 'To' (Two). The fevered boy takes it, struggles to swallow, green liquid dripping from corner of mouth. With each Danish word, temperature seems to drop - frost spreading on walls near where Danish is spoken, as if language itself brings cold. The hákarl pieces have black fibers running through them, pulsing slightly. Industrial contamination already in the food. Magnús's tremor makes pointing unstable, hákarl pieces shaking. House breathing maintains 13/min but heartbeat underneath beginning - subtle, might be imagination. Six shadows on wall, sixth shadow moving though no sixth person counted yet.",
      
      "scene": "Morning sorting ritual, 5:49 AM, light growing outside but still dim. Temperature drops from -8°C to -9°C as Danish spoken. Frost spreading on north wall in dendritic patterns where Danish words hit. The hákarl on plate shows five pieces cut but six exist. Each piece releasing visible ammonia that makes eyes water. Breath vapor from everyone, but during Danish, breath seems to freeze mid-air briefly.",
