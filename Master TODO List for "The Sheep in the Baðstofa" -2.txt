Master TODO List for "The Sheep in the Baðstofa" - Complete Technical Implementation
SECTION A: STRUCTURAL FOUNDATIONS
A1. Pacing Architecture

 Fibonacci Duration Map (create shot-by-shot timing document):

Shots 1-10: 3, 5, 8, 5, 3, 8, 13, 5, 8, 21 seconds
Shots 11-20: 8, 5, 13, 8, 21, 3, 5, 8, 13, 8 seconds
[Continue for all 85-90 shots]


 Silence Events (2-3 second black frames, breathing only):

After Shot 9a: 3 seconds, 11 breaths/min
After Shot 17: 2 seconds, accelerating 11→15/min
After Shot 25: 3 seconds, 8/12/20 polyrhythm
After Shot 45c: 2 seconds, 3 breaths/min (dying)
After Shot 57: 3 seconds, sheep breathing revealed


 Extended Holds:

Shot 13 (Raven): 12 seconds absolute stillness
Shot 52a (Second Raven): 12 seconds
Shot 59b (Third Monolith): 12 seconds
Shot 61: 30-second forensic examination



A2. Aspect Ratio Evolution Timeline

 Create technical specification sheet:

Prologue: 1.85:1 (false freedom)
Shots 1-7: 4:3 (trap springs) - transition at Shot 1, 3 seconds
Shots 8-10: 1:1 (counting violence) - snap to square
Shots 11-42: Return to 4:3
Shots 43: 1:1 (violence)
Shots 49-50: 1:1 (incest threat)
Shot 59+: 2.39:1 explosion over 5 seconds



SECTION B: CRITICAL NARRATIVE FIXES
B1. Five-Moment Dripping Match Cut (Complete Implementation)

 Shot 4.5: Hákarl ammonia dripping into bucket (establish sound: 1.2 seconds between drops)
 Shot 22: Magnús's aflausn blood from nose (same 1.2-second interval)
 Shot 25: Tilberi's verdigris tears hitting floor (exact same sound, green instead of red)
 Shot 45c: Griðungur's contamination bleeding into polynya (massive scale, same rhythm)
 Shot 61: Monument moisture beading on obsidian (eternal continuation)
 Audio specification: Each drip at 87dB, 440Hz impact with 2-second decay

B2. Feast-to-Starvation Instantaneous Transformation

 New Shot 9b (3 seconds):

Sun touches horizon: feast perfect
Sun disappears: INSTANT freeze - all food crystallizes
Meat develops black veins in real-time
Purple juice cracks vessels with glass-breaking sound
Bread becomes stone (literal petrification)
Single frame of abundance/death simultaneously



B3. Four Corners Summoning (Replacing Tilberi)

 Shot 23 Restructure:

North (Magnús): Blood from hidden cut
South (Guðrún): Wool pulled from wrists
East (Children): Breath visible as white shapes
West (Sigrid): Says her name backward
Center: Tilberi manifests from failed ritual



SECTION C: VEO3 TECHNICAL WORKAROUNDS
C1. Complex Shot Fragmentation Strategy

 Transformation Sequences (Human to Sheep):

Shot 56a: Human hands reaching → CUT
Shot 56b: Shadow shows hooves → CUT
Shot 56c: Sheep hands revealed


 Multiple Reality Shots:

Shot 51c: Show floor → CUT → Show réttir below → CUT → Overlay glimpse


 Synchronization Workarounds:

Never show more than 3 characters breathing in single shot
Use shadows for synchronized movement
Audio carries synchronization across cuts



C2. Character Consistency Protocol

 Anchor Points (unchanging elements to maintain across shots):

Magnús: Silver wedding ring, cane
Guðrún: Faldbúningur headdress
Sigrid: Three freckles in triangle
Children: Specific height markers


 Degradation Excuses (when consistency fails):

Blame on "memory corruption"
Use frost on lens to obscure
Quick cuts during changes



C3. Emergency Simplification Plans

 If Sheep Transformation Fails: Show only shadows and sounds
 If Breathing Sync Fails: Use fog to obscure mouths
 If Obelisk Fails: Show only reflection in water

SECTION E: VISUAL SPECIFICATIONS
E1. Color Grading LUT Progression

 Prologue: Oversaturated warmth (LUT: "Carnivore_Abundance_01")
 Act I: Desaturated realism (LUT: "Winter_Truth_01")
 Act II: Color bleeding at edges (LUT: "Madness_Bleed_01")
 Act III: Monochrome except red (LUT: "Blood_Memory_01")
 Act IV: Full desaturation (LUT: "Monument_01")

E2. Shadow Behavior Bible

 Lag Specifications:

Normal scenes: 0.5 second lag
Violence scenes: 1.0 second lag
Transformation: 2.0 second lag
Death scenes: Shadows lead by 0.5 seconds


 Shadow Mapping Per Character:

Magnús: Shadow always larger
Guðrún: Shadow shows ewe profile
Sigrid: Shadow has wings after Shot 23
Children: Shadows remain still during violence



E3. Stain Progression Tracking

 Create continuity chart:

Shot 1-10: Clean clothes
Shot 11-20: Blood stains appear
Shot 21-30: Purple juice added
Shot 31-40: Egg yolk completes trinity
Shot 41-50: Stains darken to brown-black
Shot 51-63: Stains become patterns



SECTION F: PERFORMANCE DIRECTION
F1. Antarctic Stare Implementation

 Specific Shots Requiring Stare:

Shot 4: Magnús at window
Shot 14: Family after mathematical break
Shot 32: Magnús alone on water
Shot 41: Guðrún after beating


SECTION G: DIALOG REVISION TAGS
G1. Danish Contamination Shots

 Shot 8: "En, to" - mechanical counting
 Shot 9: "Tre, fire, fem" - with violation
 Shot 10: "Seks?" - confusion
 Shot 50b: Administrative register during grooming
 Tag each with: Temperature drop per word, frost pattern


H2. Temperature Log

 Create master temperature tracking:

Prologue: +5°C (false warmth)
Shot 1-20: -10°C
Shot 21-40: -20°C
Shot 41-55: -25°C
Shot 56-63: -30°C


SECTION I: QUALITY CONTROL CHECKLISTS
I1. Per-Shot Verification

 Breath rate specified
 Shadow behavior noted
 Temperature documented
 Dominant reality tagged
 5/6 impossibility present
 Degradation level marked
 Dialog language identified

I2. Match Cut Verification

 Five-drip sequence sound identical
 Whale eye → Raven eye → Sigrid eye
 Burning lamp → Trawler → Match
 Ram horn → Mountain → Obsidian


This comprehensive TODO addresses all technical gaps while maintaining narrative integrity. The key addition is explicit fragmentation strategies for VEO3's limitations and proper tracking systems for continuity.
