Sound Design: Layer all audio elements
Color Grade: Match all shots to consistent look
Final Pass: Trim, adjust, perfect

Ambiguity must remain (poisoning vs. transformation)
Anchor consistency throughout

Quality Markers

No obvious AI artifacts
Seamless FTV transitions
Natural pacing rhythm
Effective sound design
Emotional impact


FINAL PRODUCTION NOTES
The Core Truth
This film asks: When a family destroys itself under impossible pressure, is transformation into animals escape, punishment, or mercy? The answer must remain unknowable.
The Method
We're not fighting AI limitations - we're using them. The inability to show transformation forces us to create better horror through suggestion. The need for absolute anchors creates discipline that serves the story.
The Vision
This is not "content" - this is art. Every frame should feel necessary. Every cut should feel inevitable. The whole should haunt.
The Promise
If we maintain discipline through all 79 shots, if we resist shortcuts, if we honor the anchor system, if we protect the ambiguity - we will create something genuinely disturbing and original.

FINAL WORD: This document is your bible. Trust it. When generation fails, return to these anchors. When edits feel wrong, check the pacing notes. When sound feels off, reference the specifications. Everything you need is here.
The sheep in the baðstofa are waiting to be born. Or revealed. Or imagined by a poisoned mind.
We may never know which.
That's the point.
