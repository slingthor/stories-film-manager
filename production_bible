The Sheep in the Baðstofa - Final Production Bible v2.0
A 12-Minute Icelandic Horror Film
CRITICAL PRODUCTION PHILOSOPHY
The Three-Layer Reality (Absolute Foundation)
Every frame must support three simultaneous truths, never collapsing to singular explanation:

Physical Reality: Hákarl neurotoxins (trimethylamine oxide), starvation ketosis, hypothermia confusion, ergot contamination in stored grain
Psychological Reality: Dissociative fugue from trauma, folie à famille (shared psychosis), guilt manifestation, collective hysteria from isolation
Supernatural Reality: Tilberi invocation answered literally, forystufé judgment, huldufolk intervention, transformation as escape/punishment

Testing Principle: If a shot definitively proves only one interpretation, rewrite it.
The Action Blindspot Solution (Production Reality)
AI image generation cannot convincingly render:

Complex physical interactions between subjects
Transformation moments or morphing
Precise emotional expressions during action
Multiple subjects interacting dynamically

Our Solution - Show Only:

Aftermath states (swinging lamp, not the strike)
Before/after positions (human face, then sheep face)
Environmental evidence (tracks in snow, scattered wool)
Implied action through sound design

Scale as Narrative Architecture
Camera movement creates meaning:

Cosmic Distance → Divine abandonment
Domestic Compression → Inescapable proximity
Personal Intimacy → Inside the breaking mind
Cosmic Return → Abandoned to consequences

Prompt Engineering Principles

Front-load critical elements: Main subject first, then environment, then details
Use photographic language: "Close-up," "wide shot," "shallow depth of field"
Specify lighting direction: "Lamp light from left," "backlit by window"
Include material textures: "Rough wool," "smooth ice," "weathered wood"
Lock camera angles: "Eye level," "looking up," "45-degree angle"
Add atmospheric particles: "Dust motes," "breath vapor," "smoke wisps"

Prompt Engineering Guidelines
Structure Every Prompt As:

Shot type/angle (Wide shot, Close-up, Aerial)
Primary subject with full description
Action/position if any
Environment with complete details
Lighting direction and quality
Atmosphere (particles, weather, etc.)
Technical notes (depth of field, motion, etc.)

Power Words for AI Generation:

Lighting: "Rembrandt lighting," "harsh shadows," "golden hour," "single source"
Atmosphere: "dust motes," "breath vapor," "crystalline," "particles"
Texture: "weathered," "rough-hewn," "crystallized," "matted"
Mood: "liminal," "uncanny," "suffocating," "vast"

Avoid These Terms:

Emotional descriptors ("sad," "angry," "desperate")
Complex interactions ("fighting," "arguing," "embracing")
Specific expressions ("smiling," "crying," "grimacing")
Abstract concepts ("poverty," "isolation," "tradition")

Sound Design Layers
Frequency Architecture:

Sub-40Hz: House foundation creaking (felt not heard)
70-90Hz: Trawler horn (industrial presence)
200-800Hz: Breathing ambiguity (human/animal)
1000-3000Hz: Wind through gaps (constant anxiety)
Above 8000Hz: Ice crystallizing (subtle terror)

Critical Sound Moments:

Shot 37b: 15-second hold needs evolving soundscape
Shot 38c: Complete silence for 4 seconds must feel wrong
Shot 57: Bleat-to-voice transformation is the film's audio climax
Shot 58b: Fade to absolute silence over final 6 seconds

Dialogue Placement (Magnús only speaks):

"Tíu...ellefu...nei..." (Shot 11 - counting confusion)
"You hide food while we starve!" (Shot 28b)

The Three-Layer Reality Checklist
Each Act Must Contain:

Physical Evidence: Poisoned meat, dilated pupils, scratched bowls
Psychological Markers: Counting problems, perception breaks, shared behaviors
Supernatural Elements: Impossible physics, ritual components, transformations

Never Resolve Whether:

The sheep are transformed family OR dying family covered in wool
Magnús is hallucinating OR seeing truth
The ritual worked OR coincidence occurred
The ram was supernatural OR Magnús imagined it

Cultural Authenticity Markers
Must Include:

Hákarl: Fermented shark as actual survival food
Tilberi: Fragmentary folk magic for milk-stealing
Forystufé: Lead sheep with supernatural significance
Níðstöng: Curse poles against enemies
Faldbúningur: Specific Icelandic women's headdress
Morgundrengur: Morning confusion state
Sjávargalinn: Shark-poisoning madness

Must Avoid:

Generic "Viking" imagery
Modern Icelandic references
Christian overtones (use pagan/folk elements)
Contemporary speech patterns

Visual Motif Tracking
Cross Patterns:

Shot 2b: Empty drying rack
Shot 7b: Frost on window
Shot 9b: Crossed firewood
Shot 11c: Children's rib bones
Shot 14: Ritual arrangement
Shot 35: Sigrid's ritual

V-Notches (The Missing Ram):

Shot 2c: Wall counting marks
Shot 24: Seal flipper
Shot 39: Ram's ear

Black in White (Corruption):

Shot 10b: Black thread in white fabric
Shot 40: Coal rope in wool
Shot 43: Dilated pupils
Shot 50: Dark shapes in white wool

Extended Shot Strategies
To achieve 12-minute runtime with 82 shots:
Hold Discomfort:

Let silences extend past comfort
Static shots where only snow moves
Breathing as primary sound
No cutting during transformations

Use Tableau Staging:

Family positioned like paintings
Minimal movement within frames
Environmental motion only (smoke, snow)
Eyes tell story, not actions

Reality Breaks:

Physics violations subtle but present
Shadows wrong for light sources
Breath patterns not matching visible sources
Time seeming to skip or repeat

Final Assembly Notes
Pacing Structure:

Opening: Slow, cosmic (average 8 sec/shot)
Act I: Building tension (average 7 sec/shot)
Boat/Violence: Quick cuts (average 6 sec/shot)
Night Journey: Extended holds (average 10 sec/shot)
Revelation: Painfully slow (average 12 sec/shot)

The Film's Core Question:
Not "What happened?" but "What does it mean that we cannot know what happened?"
The Three Endings Simultaneously True:

Realistic: Family dead under wool, Magnús poisoned/insane
Psychological: Shared delusion from isolation/starvation
Supernatural: Tilberi magic transformed them

All three exist in quantum superposition. The film collapses into meaning only in each viewer's mind.

FINAL WORD: This film succeeds if audiences leave arguing not about what they saw, but about what reality itself means when survival strips away certainty. The horror isn't the sheep—it's the impossibility of knowing if there are sheep at all.
