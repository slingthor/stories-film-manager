The Sheep in the Baðstofa - Ultimate Shot Production Guide v7.0
Complete Self-Contained Inline Prompt Manual with Dual-Track Production Paths
MASTER PRODUCTION PHILOSOPHY
Each shot in this guide is a complete, self-contained production unit. Copy the prompt and specifications directly - no cross-referencing needed. Every shot includes both PRAGMATIC (achievable) and AMBITIOUS (ideal) versions, complete sound design, post-production notes, and composite instructions.
CRITICAL PRODUCTION WISDOM
AI Generation Reality:

Single subjects work better than groups
Static holds better than complex movement
Atmosphere succeeds where interaction fails
Generate elements separately, unite in post

Sound Design Philosophy:

Environmental sound tells the story when dialogue cannot
The house speaks: creaking beams (low stress 200Hz, high stress 400Hz)
Ice forms audibly: crystallization at 8kHz creates unease
Breath rhythms identify humanity: 12-15/min human, 8-10/min dying, 20-25/min sheep
The trawler horn grows from 70Hz (distant) to 90Hz (overwhelming)

Three-Layer Reality Maintenance:
Every shot readable as:

P (Physical): Poisoning/starvation/hypothermia
S (Psychological): Shared madness/trauma/dissociation
M (Metaphysical): Supernatural transformation/divine punishment


PROLOGUE: COSMIC ABANDONMENT (0:00-0:55)
Establishing divine departure and scale

FINAL WORDS
This shot guide represents the complete vision of "The Sheep in the Baðstofa" - a film about the impossibility of knowing truth when reality itself becomes unreliable.
The match cut from dying flame to trawler light contains the entire theme.
The headdress on the sheep is the image that will haunt forever.
The voice saying "Mamma?" is the moment reality dies.
The count that produces six from five is mathematics failing.
Every prompt, every specification, every sound cue serves the central paradox:
The horror is not the sheep.
The horror is not knowing if there are sheep.
The horror is that both answers are simultaneously true.
This paradox IS the film.

END OF ULTIMATE SHOT PRODUCTION GUIDE v7.0
In the end, we count five but find six.
In the end, the industrial witness sees nothing.
In the end, even the gods have abandoned us to the sheep.
