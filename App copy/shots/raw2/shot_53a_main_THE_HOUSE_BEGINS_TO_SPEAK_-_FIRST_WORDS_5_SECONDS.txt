[STITCH from Shot 52c: MagnÃºs reaching for Sigrid]

Subject: The entire house suddenly speaking at 16Hz through walls, floor, and beams simultaneously: "Ã‰G ER BERGRISI" - the words visible as dust falling from ceiling in letter patterns, while a 55-year-old man in brown wool and a 16-year-old girl in grey dress freeze as the giant identifies itself.

Action: WIDE SHOT of interior. MagnÃºs's hand on Sigrid's shoulder. Then: everything vibrates. 16Hz through structure - below human hearing, felt in bones, teeth, eyeballs. Words emerge from everywhere: "Ã‰G ER BERGRISI." Not spoken but manifested. Dust cascades from ceiling, forming the letters briefly before dispersing. The three beams (ribs) flex visibly with each syllable. Floor becomes soft, warm, alive - exactly 37Â°C, body temperature. Windows fog instantly from house's breath. Everyone freezes. Even the tilberi stops its three-rhythm breathing. The empty clothes fall to ground like abandoned puppets. Only movement: dust letters forming and dissolving. "Ã‰G... ER... BERGRISI." Each word makes the house more obviously body - walls perspiring, doorway like throat, smoke hole like nostril.

Scene: Entire interior as speaking cavity. Family frozen mid-action. House revealing itself as giant's body.

Style: Wide vibrating with 16Hz resonance (that's where the camera is), giant's announcement documented.

Dialogue: (House/Bergrisi): "Ã‰G ER BERGRISI" (visual as dust letters)

Sounds: [PRIMARY: 16Hz vibration through everything, dust forming letters, beams flexing] [AMBIENT: House breathing 6/min labored, heartbeat 70bpm stressed] [ABSENT: no human sound possible]

Visual Elements for VEO3:

Dust falling in letter shapes
Beams flexing like ribs
Walls perspiring droplets
Floor soft and warm
Everyone frozen in position
