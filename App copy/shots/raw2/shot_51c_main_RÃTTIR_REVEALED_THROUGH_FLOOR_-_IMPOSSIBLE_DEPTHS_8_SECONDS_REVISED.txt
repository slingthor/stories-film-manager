SHOT 51c: RÃ‰TTIR REVEALED THROUGH FLOOR - IMPOSSIBLE DEPTHS (8 SECONDS) [REVISED]
Progressive State: House 8/min + 60bpm | Stone pens emerging | Camera frost 41% | Ancient truth visible | Watching: Floor reveals purpose
Women's Silence: GuÃ°rÃºn sees but accepts
Triple Reality: Physical: floor wearing through | Psychological: always were livestock | Mythological: inside Bergrisi's stomach
Duration: 8 seconds
Camera Movement: Crane up from floor detail to reveal full pattern
[STITCH from Shot 51b: Clothes counted seven]

Subject: The floor suddenly transparent in sections, revealing stone rÃ©ttir (sorting pens) 10 feet below - ancient, massive, impossible depth for a house - with sheep already sorted in the pens below, but the sheep wear the family's clothes, and one pen holds a raven.

Action: CLOSE ON FLOOR - packed earth becomes translucent like ice. Through it: stone structures below. CRANE UP slowly revealing full pattern. Ancient rÃ©ttir, the circular stone sorting pens, but 10 feet down - impossible, house is on ground level. Five stone pens radiating from center, sixth pen different - newer, Danish construction. In the pens: sheep. But wearing clothes. Ram with MagnÃºs's sweater. Ewe with GuÃ°rÃºn's faldbÃºningur. Lambs with children's dresses. Fifth pen: young ewe with subtle belly, Sigrid's dress. Sixth pen: enormous raven, watching up through floor. The sheep below move when family above moves - synchronized. Or is family moving because sheep move? Which controls which? MagnÃºs drops to knees, pressing hands to floor: "HvaÃ° er fyrir neÃ°an?" Through transparent section, the ram below presses hooves up. They touch through impossible space. Below the rÃ©ttir: glimpse of pink flesh, rhythmic pulsing. They're in Bergrisi's stomach. The rÃ©ttir are his digestive system. The house is his mouth.

Scene: Interior floor becoming window to impossible depth. Stone rÃ©ttir ancient but perfect. Sheep-family below/above.

Style: Crane revealing impossible architecture below (that's where the camera is), vertical impossibility documented.

Dialogue: (MagnÃºs, horrified): "HvaÃ° er fyrir neÃ°an?" (Sigrid, knowing): "ViÃ°. ViÃ° erum fyrir neÃ°an" "Og viÃ° erum fyrir ofan. BÃ¦Ã°i." (And we're above. Both.)

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Floor becoming transparent, stone scraping below, sheep breathing beneath] [AMBIENT: Bergrisi's stomach rumbling below rÃ©ttir, synchronized movement above/below] [ABSENT: no logical explanation]

Visual Composition:

Transparent floor: Like looking through ice
Stone rÃ©ttir: Ancient sorting architecture
Depth impossible: 10 feet down in ground floor
Sheep dressed: Wearing family's clothes
Raven waiting: In sixth pen alone
Pink flesh deeper: Bergrisi's insides
Technical (Negative Prompt): maintain impossible depth, show both levels clearly
