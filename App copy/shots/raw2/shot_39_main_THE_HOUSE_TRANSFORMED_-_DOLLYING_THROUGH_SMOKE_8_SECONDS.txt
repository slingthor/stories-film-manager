SHOT 39: THE HOUSE TRANSFORMED - DOLLYING THROUGH SMOKE (8 SECONDS)
Progressive State: House 3/min dying + 40bpm weak | Post-summoning aftermath | Camera frost 25.5% | Interior transformed | Watching: Four landvÃ¦ttir through windows
Women's Silence: Broken then reformed in new pattern
Triple Reality: Physical: structural change / Psychological: collective shock / Mythological: inside the dying god
Duration: 8 seconds
Camera Movement: Dolly forward through smoke hole into transformed space
[STITCH from Shot 38b: Aerial view of MagnÃºs rowing home]

Subject: Camera descending through smoke hole into the house, dollying forward through thick smoke to reveal the family arranged in perfect rÃ©ttir formation on the floor - five positions in pentagon with sixth empty - while the tilberi creation sits at center breathing its three rhythms, and through smoke, glimpses of impossible changes: walls wet with perspiration, floor showing stone patterns, everyone's breath synchronized at 11/min except [SIGRID].

Action: CAMERA ENTERS through smoke hole, DOLLYING FORWARD through smoke that shouldn't exist (fire long dead). Smoke parts revealing: Family on floor in exact rÃ©ttir positions - the children saw truth and arranged everyone. GuÃ°rÃºn kneeling at first position, silent again. JÃ³n at second despite fever, eyes closed. Lilja at third, humming Krummi tune. Sigrid at fifth position, maintaining distance from center, breathing still 15/min (unchanged). Fourth position MagnÃºs's empty space. Sixth position has body-shaped depression in floor but empty. At center: tilberi creation, size of cat, rope skeleton visible, brass eye weeping. Its three-rhythm breathing (8/12/20) creating polyrhythm. DOLLY CONTINUES revealing: Walls literally wet, perspiring at body temperature. Floor stones visible through worn earth - ancient rÃ©ttir always underneath. Through windows in background: trawler lights gone but steam from polynya (Bull stirring), mountain shadows wrong angle (Raven influence), house breathing so labored it's visible in beam movement.

Scene: Interior transformed, 9:35 AM but dark from smoke. Temperature 37Â°C at floor (body heat) but -20Â°C at head height. Impossible thermodynamics.

Style: Steady forward dolly through smoke, revealing family tableau (that's where the camera is), documentary entering aftermath.

Dialogue: (Lilja, humming): "VerÃ°ur margt aÃ° meini..." (Sigrid, only one speaking): "Pabbi kemur... meÃ° dauÃ°a" (Father comes... with death) (Others): Synchronized breathing only

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Dolly through smoke, three-rhythm breathing from tilberi, house perspiring with dripping] [AMBIENT: Family at 11/min (impossible rate), Sigrid at 15/min, stone rÃ©ttir grinding below] [ABSENT: no normal activity, frozen tableau]

Visual Composition:

Foreground smoke: Obscuring then revealing
Pentagon formation: Five positions plus empty sixth
Center focus: Tilberi as wrong shepherd
Background windows: Four landvÃ¦ttir influences visible
Vertical layers: Hot floor, cold air, impossible physics
Technical (Negative Prompt): maintain dolly movement, no cuts, reveal through smoke parting
