SHOT 5: DESCENT INTO THE TRAP (REVISED WITH PREGNANCY)
[Previous content remains, but updating Sigrid's description and adding subtle details]

Subject: [Continuing previous description until Sigrid] On the middle sleeping platform exactly 10 feet from MagnÃºs [SIGRID - FULL PLATE REVISED]: Sigrid, a 16-year-old girl with heart-shaped face, high delicate cheekbones, small straight nose with three freckles forming tiny triangle, full lips naturally pink despite cold, grey eyes sharp with amber flecks near pupils like volcanic ash containing hidden fire, wheat-blonde hair in two tight braids reaching mid-back, 5'4" lean build with subtle fullness at belly barely visible under patched grey-brown wool dress strategically loose at waist, dress too small at wrists showing growth, dark wool stockings with holes at heels. Her left hand unconsciously rests protective over lower abdomen while right hand steadies against wall. Body angled to maintain escape route while protecting midsection, spine pressed against wall where faint patterns might be cracks or might be shadows. When she shifts, careful to keep belly turned away from MagnÃºs's sightline, though he tracks her movement knowingly.
