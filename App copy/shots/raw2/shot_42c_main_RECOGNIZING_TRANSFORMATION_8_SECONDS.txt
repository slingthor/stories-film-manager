SHOT 42c: RECOGNIZING TRANSFORMATION (8 SECONDS)
Progressive State: House exhales 3/min | Rage building | Camera frost 28% | Authority challenged | Watching: House watching him realize
Women's Silence: Truth in positioning
Triple Reality: Physical: family changed / Psychological: control lost / Mythological: hierarchy inverted
Duration: 8 seconds
Camera Movement: Circular track around him as he sees
[STITCH from Shot 42b: Fin revealed, family watching]

Subject: Camera circling [MAGNÃšS] as he takes in the transformed scene - family in rÃ©ttir formation, children's sheep teeth visible, GuÃ°rÃºn pulling wool from wrists, tilberi at center where he should be, his authority usurped by contaminated creation.

Action: CAMERA BEGINS CIRCLING as MagnÃºs turns, taking in disaster. First quarter: Sees GuÃ°rÃºn on floor, not standing for his return, wool hanging from her wrists like she's becoming material. Second quarter: JÃ³n and Lilja, mouths open showing sheep teeth, breathing at 20/min (lamb rate), his son's fever breaking but eyes animal-bright. Third quarter: Tilberi at center where patriarch should stand, rope skeleton visible, brass eye weeping, breathing three rhythms, family arranged around IT not him. Final quarter: Sigrid maintaining exactly 11 feet even now, hand protective on belly (feeding two), only one breathing at different rate (15/min unchanged). Complete circle shows his position: standing outside their formation. He's excluded. Not needed. Failed provider, failed protector, failed patriarch. Rage builds. Drops fin. 0Hz hands clench (can't feel nails breaking skin). House exhales finally - long, dying breath at 3/min.

Scene: Full interior revealed in rotation. Family floor-level, him standing isolated. Tilberi as new center.

Style: 360Â° track around MagnÃºs, showing his isolation from every angle (that's where the camera is), authority dissolved.

Dialogue: (MagnÃºs, building rage): "Af hverju... af hverju eruÃ° Ã¾iÃ°..." (Seeing tilberi): "HVAÃ ER ÃžETTA?" (To GuÃ°rÃºn): "ÃžÃš... Ã¾Ãº gerÃ°ir Ã¾etta?"

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Camera circling, fin dropping wet, rage building in breath] [AMBIENT: House finally exhaling long death breath, tilberi's three rhythms, family synchronized] [ABSENT: no explanation, silence as defiance]

Technical (Negative Prompt): maintain circular movement, no cuts, show transformation evidence
