Subject: [SIGRID]-raven flying alongside GAMMUR across Iceland's landscape but each wingbeat takes them through different time - over 1888's frozen fjords, through 1944's independence celebration, past 2024's tourist buses at the black obelisk, all in single flight.

Action: AERIAL TRACKING both ravens. Gammur leads, massive wings cutting through time itself. Each downbeat: different era. First beat: 1888 below, frozen fjord, trawler still circling in eternal ouroboros (frozen in ice). Second beat: 1904, Danish administration buildings rising. Third beat: 1920, Sigrid laying her egg on cathedral roof - the human child emerging from raven egg. Fourth beat: 1940, British occupation, tanks replacing Danish clerks. Fifth beat: 1944, June 17, independence day, crowds cheering, Sigrid (aged 72, human again) in crowd, looking up, SEEING her younger raven self flying over, remembering. Sixth beat: 2024, the obelisk a tourist destination, children on school trips, guides explaining "the family preserved inside represents colonial sacrifice." Seventh beat: future unknown, Iceland green, warm, different. Gammur speaks while flying: "Ãžetta er Ã¾aÃ° sem Ã¾Ãº verÃ°ur aÃ° muna" (This is what you must remember). All of it. Every moment. The witness carries all.

Scene: Flying across all Iceland times. Landscape changing below. History visible. Future glimpsed.

Style: Aerial tracking through time (that's where the camera is), memory flight documented.

Dialogue: (Gammur): "Ãžetta er Ã¾aÃ° sem Ã¾Ãº verÃ°ur aÃ° muna" (Sigrid, 1944): Looking up: "Ã‰g man" (I remember)
