[STITCH from Shot 4: Camera moves from window through smoke hole]

Subject: The camera descends through the smoke hole into the cramped turf house, revealing the entire family in morning positions. At the pine table sits [MAGNÃšS - FULL PLATE]: MagnÃºs, a 55-year-old Icelandic fisherman with weathered rectangular face, prominent Nordic cheekbones, broken aquiline nose bent leftward from old fight, thin cracked lips, deep-set steel-blue hooded eyes with crow's feet, thick grey unkempt beard reaching mid-chest with ice crystals perpetually frozen in whiskers, shoulder-length grey hair greasy and matted, 5'10" broad-shouldered stocky build, wearing brown homespun vaÃ°mÃ¡l wool sweater with visible mending at left elbow and right shoulder, dark wool trousers patched at knees, his smooth driftwood cane with plain handle leaning against table, hunched aggressive posture, jaw clenched making beard twitch at 3Hz tremor, baseline mood of barely contained rage. Beside him [GUÃRÃšN - FULL PLATE]: GuÃ°rÃºn, a 35-year-old Icelandic woman with oval face prematurely aged by hunger, hollow cheeks, straight narrow nose, pale lips pressed into permanent thin line, grey-green almond eyes with dark circles, dark brown hair completely hidden under white curved faldbÃºningur headdress with black velvet band, 5'5" thin frame in grey wool dress with brown apron bearing old stains, black wool shawl, shoulders permanently curved inward, hands red from cold, watching MagnÃºs constantly while remaining silent. On the middle sleeping platform exactly 10 feet from MagnÃºs [SIGRID - FULL PLATE]: Sigrid, a 16-year-old girl with heart-shaped face, high delicate cheekbones, small straight nose with three freckles forming tiny triangle, full lips naturally pink despite cold, grey eyes sharp with amber flecks near pupils like volcanic ash containing hidden fire, wheat-blonde hair in two tight braids reaching mid-back, 5'4" lean build, patched grey-brown wool dress too small at wrists, dark wool stockings with holes at heels, body angled to maintain escape route, spine pressed against wall where faint patterns might be cracks or might be shadows. Curled beside her [LILJA - FULL PLATE]: Lilja, a 5-year-old girl with cherubic round face, huge blue eyes, tangled dark blonde hair with uneven bangs, 3'6" tall, grey wool dress with torn hem, clutching cloth doll with brass button eyes that catch lamplight, thumb in mouth. Between parents [JÃ“N - FULL PLATE]: JÃ³n, an 8-year-old boy with round face flushed with fever, sandy brown hair plastered to forehead with sweat, hazel eyes glazed, thin frame showing ribs, oversized brown wool sweater, trembling from 39Â°C fever, wet cough into cupped hands.

Action: Camera settles into room as Sigrid sings the Krummi lullaby to Lilja, her clear voice the only sustained female sound we'll hear. "Krummi svaf Ã­ klettagjÃ¡, kaldri vetrarnÃ³ttu Ã¡" - the words float through visible breath vapor, each family member's breath creating white clouds that linger. MagnÃºs sits at table head examining something hidden in his lap - a small piece of bread he doesn't share, quickly concealing it when GuÃ°rÃºn glances over. She remains completely silent, mechanically preparing the morning's hÃ¡karl, now 13 days into its 90-day fermentation, the meat grey-green and glistening. The floor shows worn patterns from daily movement - five distinct paths that might be random or might be sorting positions. In the corner, a pile of empty clothes arranged as if bodies evacuated them. Through the song, six shadows visible on the wall though only five people present - the sixth at empty chair position.

Scene: [FULL SPATIAL LOCK] Interior of 12Ã—16ft turf house with 6ft ceiling forcing all adults to hunch. Walls 1-meter thick turf with herringbone pattern, straw and moss visible. Three exposed wooden beams (giant's ribs) running lengthwise, dark with tar. Packed earth floor with wear patterns. Single 2Ã—2ft south window, frost covered. 5ft wooden door northeast corner. Smoke hole above table showing grey pre-dawn. Pine table 4ft from west wall, surface scarred with old cuts. Sleeping platforms along east wall at 1ft, 3ft, 5ft heights. 3Ã—3ft stone hearth north wall, peat fire struggling. Southwest corner darker, subtle V-shapes in wall that might be natural. Temperature -25Â°C outside but -8Â°C inside, every breath visible as white vapor lasting 3 seconds before dispersing.

Style: Wide establishing shot from northeast corner showing full spatial arrangement, camera at 5ft height (that's where the camera is), practical lighting from struggling oil lamp and weak hearth fire, documentary observation of morning routine.

Dialogue: (Sigrid, singing): "Krummi svaf Ã­ klettagjÃ¡, kaldri vetrarnÃ³ttu Ã¡" (Tone: gentle lullaby, only female voice) (MagnÃºs, hiding bread): Breath catches, no words (GuÃ°rÃºn): Complete silence despite working

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Sigrid's clear singing, MagnÃºs concealing bread, knife on hÃ¡karl] [AMBIENT: House breathing 12/min, varied individual breathing visible, peat fire crackling weakly, wind outside at 40mph] [ABSENT: no music, no other female voices, no acknowledgment of sixth shadow]

Technical (Negative Prompt): no subtitles, no text overlays, no modern elements, maintain -25Â°C visibility, documentary realism
