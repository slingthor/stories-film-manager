SHOT 46a: MUTUAL RECOGNITION - THE V-NOTCH (6 SECONDS)
Progressive State: Two trapped gods | Understanding | Camera frost 33% | Livestock marked | Watching: Each other
Women's Silence: Communication through eyes
Triple Reality: Physical: bull and woman | Psychological: trauma recognized | Mythological: gods enslaved
Duration: 6 seconds
Camera Movement: Slow zoom on Bull's ear, then cut to her ear
[STITCH from Shot 45c: Bull emerged, 15-second hold ending]

Subject: Camera slowly zooming on GRIÃUNGUR's left ear revealing a V-notch cut - the livestock marking - then cutting to [GUÃRÃšN]'s ear where beneath her hair, an identical V-shaped scar exists, both marked as property by different masters.

Action: SLOW ZOOM begins on Bull's massive head, pushing toward left ear. Through steam and contamination, detail resolves: V-notch cut in ear, traditional livestock marking. But around it, infected - brass fixtures growing from wound edges, green verdigris staining fur. The cut old, decades maybe, from when he was young, before divinity, when he was just cattle. ZOOM continues tighter - inside the V, tiny numbers etched: Danish registration. He was counted. Administered. Made property. CUT TO: GuÃ°rÃºn's ear, her hair pulled back by wind. Same V-scar beneath hairline, but subtle, hidden. From childhood - father's mark? Husband's? Denmark's? The scar white against skin, old trauma. Her hand rises unconsciously to touch it. Bull sees her gesture. Lowers massive head. Their eyes meet - livestock to livestock, property to property. He breathes out steam. She breathes out vapor. Same rhythm: 11/minute. The impossible synchronized rate. Both accepting their marking.

Scene: Polynya edge, 10:01 AM grey light. Steam creating intimate space around them. Ice holding their weight.

Style: Zoom revealing detail, then match cut to parallel marking (that's where the camera is), documentary of shared enslavement.

Dialogue: (GuÃ°rÃºn, touching her scar): "ÃžÃº lÃ­ka... merkt" (You too... marked) (Bull): Low rumble of recognition

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Zoom lens adjusting, her fingers on scar, his breathing steam] [AMBIENT: Both at 11/min breathing, water lapping, verdigris dripping] [ABSENT: no denial, truth acknowledged]

Visual Composition:

Parallel marks: V-notch on both
Infection details: Brass growing from wound
Danish numbers: In his notch
Hidden scar: Under her hair
Eye contact: Mutual understanding
