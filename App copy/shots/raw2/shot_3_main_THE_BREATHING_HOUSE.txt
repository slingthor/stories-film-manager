SHOT 3: THE BREATHING HOUSE
Progressive State: House 12/min | KlettagjÃ¡ none | No contamination | Camera frost 2% | Sorting none | LandvÃ¦ttir sleeping
[STITCH from Shot 2: Final descent from 500 feet to house level]

Subject: The turf house from 50 feet altitude showing walls physically expanding 2 inches with each breath - turf and stone foundation visibly flexing outward then relaxing, snow sliding off grass roof in rhythmic cascades every 5 seconds, three wooden beams visible through gaps in roof like ribs beneath skin, chimney smoke pulsing in perfect synchronization with wall movement.

Action: Camera descends final 500 feet while slowly rotating 360 degrees to survey complete isolation. House walls expand outward 2 inches over 2.5 seconds (inhale), hold for 0.5 seconds, then contract over 2 seconds (exhale). Each exhale causes mini-avalanche of snow from roof. Through 2Ã—2 foot south window, five human shapes visible around table, but six shadows cast on interior wall - sixth shadow stands at head of table where no person exists. Smoke from chimney emerges in bursts, each burst 3 feet long, immediately torn horizontal by wind. During rotation, we see: no paths leading away, only converging sheep tracks; trawler has moved 100 yards closer without visible propulsion; three ravens now perched on roof, heads under wings. At closest approach (10 feet altitude), we see through smoke hole: child's hand visible for 1 second, fingers tracing patterns on wall.

Scene: Ground level, 4:49 AM, complete darkness except faint oil lamp glow through window. House dimensions 12Ã—16 feet, 6 feet tall at roof peak. Turf walls show herringbone pattern, 1 meter thick, with straw and moss visible. Stone foundation 2 feet high, mortared with what appears to be mix of clay and sheep wool. Temperature -25Â°C at ground level - cold so intense that air itself seems to crystallize at exhales. Wind 40mph, horizontal snow creating white wall. Visibility 30 meters. No vegetation visible except roof grass. Ground depression around house from centuries of weight. Ice crystals growing on exterior walls in fractal patterns.

Style: Descending and rotating camera, arriving at hover 10 feet above roof (that's where the camera is), 24mm lens showing full structure and environment, handheld shake beginning from cold, frost vignetting at 2% of frame edges.

Dialogue: (Sigrid's voice through smoke hole, muffled): "Krummi svaf Ã­ klettagjÃ¡..." (Tone: young female soprano, melody audible, words barely distinguishable through roof)

Sounds: House breathing at exactly 12 per minute with wood creaking on each expansion, turf flexing sounds like leather stretching, snow cascading off roof in rhythmic whispers, wind constant roar at 40mph, child's voice thin through smoke hole, trawler horn distant at 70Hz first warning, ravens adjusting positions with claw scrapes on frozen grass.

Technical (Negative Prompt): no subtitles, no text overlays, no modern materials visible, no electric lights, maintain period accuracy, no CGI wall flex - practical only
