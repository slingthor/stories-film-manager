Subject: [MAGNÃšS] leaning down to kiss [SIGRID]'s forehead goodnight - normal fatherly gesture - but lips staying too long, then moving to her belly, checking the pregnancy with disturbing tenderness: "Ef eitthvaÃ° kemur fyrir mÃ³Ã°ur Ã¾Ã­na..." (If something happens to your mother...).

Action: He leans down. Normal goodnight kiss coming. Lips touch forehead. Should be brief. Aren't. Stay for 3 seconds. 4. 5. She doesn't move. Can't define why this is wrong - no one taught boundaries. No other families to compare. His lips finally lift but move to her belly. "Ã‰g Ã¾arf aÃ° athuga" (I need to check). Hands follow, feeling the small swell. Checking his grandchild? His future child? Both? "Ef eitthvaÃ° kemur fyrir mÃ³Ã°ur Ã¾Ã­na..." Trails off. Implication clear. She's backup. Insurance. Breeding stock with tenderness. His 0Hz hands perfectly still, gentle, terrible. No tremor in love or violence. Finally stands. "SofÃ°u vel, elskan." Walks away. She remains frozen. The horror: he genuinely loves her. And sees her as future wife. Both true. Isolation allows both. No witnesses to say it's wrong.

Scene: Close intimate moment, night falling. His tenderness genuine and terrible. Her frozen acceptance.

Style: Static close shot on violation through care (that's where the camera is), boundary dissolution documented.

Dialogue: (MagnÃºs): "Ef eitthvaÃ° kemur fyrir mÃ³Ã°ur Ã¾Ã­na..." "ÃžÃº ert tilbÃºin" (You're ready) "SofÃ°u vel, elskan"

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Lips on skin too long, hands on belly, breathing close] [AMBIENT: House sleeping, her 15/min steady, raven scratching window] [ABSENT: no words for this wrong]

Technical (Negative Prompt): maintain discomfort without exploitation, show boundary violation
