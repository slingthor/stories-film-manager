      "action": "Magnús kneels on thick grass. Spreads rope in front of him. Jón kneels opposite, watching intently. Magnús's large hands take rope end. Forms loop. Passes end through. Pulls to create bowline knot. Unties it. Hands rope to Jón. Boy's smaller hands try to copy. Makes wrong loop. Magnús places his hands over boy's, guides them. Together they form knot correctly. Magnús nods once. Takes rope back. Shows second knot - clove hitch. More complex. Jón watches every movement. Behind them, cliff edge drops straight down. Ocean below shows whale's blood trail now reaching beach, spreading along shoreline. Other men visible as dots preparing flensing area. Women disappeared toward purple hills. Magnús ties rope around Jón's waist, through legs, creating harness. Tests each loop. Boy stands still, trusting.",
