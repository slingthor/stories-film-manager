      "action": "Hands everywhere reaching. No utensils. Fingers tear into whale blubber, white fat, red meat. Grease runs down wrists. Purple berry juice poured directly into mouths, overflowing, running down necks. Boiled eggs crushed in fists, yolk squirting between fingers. Everyone eating like starved despite full tables. Child gnaws whale bone. Woman drinks purple juice, eyes rolling back. Man stuffs mouth with fish and eggs simultaneously. The three stains now on everyone - blood on lips, berry juice on teeth, yolk on chins. Mixed together makes brown-black mark on faces. Same color as ground stain earlier. Magnús eats mechanically, jaw working steadily. Guðrún feeds Lilja, purple juice and whale fat. Sigrid only one not eating. Watches. Some people's chewing becomes rhythmic. Like cud chewing. Jaws moving wrong direction - sideways slightly. No one notices. Food disappearing impossibly fast but tables still full.",
