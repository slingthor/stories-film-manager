SHOT 19: THE WHALE OIL DIES
Progressive State: House 15/min + 80bpm | Old light ending | Camera frost 11% (for post) | Traditional world dying | Watching: Absence
Women's Silence: Complete silence in darkness
Triple Reality: Physical: last oil consumed / Psychological: abandonment / Mythological: old gods leaving
[STITCH from Shot 18: MagnÃºs exits with door open]

Subject: The whale oil lamp, abandoned on table with door open creating wind, flame fighting the draft and losing - shrinking from fingernail size to pinpoint to blue whisper to nothing, the last traditional light source extinguished, leaving only the memory of warmth.

Action: Door still open from MagnÃºs's exit. Arctic wind enters, -25Â°C fighting -12Â°C. The candle he used already dead. Only whale oil lamp remains, but wind finds it. Flame bends horizontal, trying to survive. Shrinks to half size. Quarter size. Pinpoint. The oil is gone - 200 years of whale oil lamps in this house, ending now. The wick glows red for moment, ember of old world. Then black. Complete darkness. Through open door, sound of MagnÃºs dragging boat through snow. Inside, family in absolute black. GuÃ°rÃºn doesn't move to close door. Children breathing but invisible. Sigrid's hand finds wall, traces "FÃ“RN" by feel. House breathing drops to 10/min, grieving. Heartbeat slows to 50bpm. The darkness is complete - not even starlight through frost. Old world dead.

Scene: Table with dying lamp, 6:22 AM but no light. Temperature plummeting from open door. The lamp that lit generations, dead. Smoke from extinguished wick rising invisible in darkness. The empty oil reservoir that once held whale blubber, now holding nothing.

Style: Extreme close on dying flame, then pulling back to absolute darkness (that's where the camera is), documentary of light's death.

Dialogue: (Wind through door): Howling (Complete silence from family) (Sigrid's fingers on wall): Scraping sound tracing letters

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Wind killing flame, wick's last gasp, oil gone, door banging] [AMBIENT: House breathing slowing to 10/min (grief), heartbeat to 50bpm, MagnÃºs dragging boat outside] [ABSENT: no voices, no light, no warmth]

Technical (Negative Prompt): no subtitles, true darkness after flame dies, maintain absence, documentary observation
