SHOT 48: BLOOD DRIPPING ENTRY (8 SECONDS)
Progressive State: House interior | Shock confrontation | Camera frost 36% | Living returned | Watching: All eyes on impossibility
Women's Silence: No explanation offered
Triple Reality: Physical: hypothermia but alive | Psychological: death sentence failed | Mythological: chosen by house
Duration: 8 seconds
Camera Movement: Circle around her as family reacts
[STITCH from either version of 47b/c: Entering house]

Subject: [GUÃRÃšN] standing in doorway dripping (water or blood depending on version), the family frozen in shock at her survival, camera circling her as each family member's reaction reveals their position - MagnÃºs's rage, children's relief, Sigrid's knowing, while the tilberi at center breathes its three rhythms welcoming her return.

Action: CAMERA BEGINS CIRCLING her in doorway. She drips - either ice-melt or blood depending on version chosen. First quarter rotation: MagnÃºs's face, rage building at failed authority. His 0Hz hands clenching. She survived his death sentence. Second quarter: Children on floor, JÃ³n showing sheep teeth in relief smile, Lilja reaching toward mother but not moving from rÃ©ttir position. Third quarter: Tilberi at center, brass eye weeping green tears, three-rhythm breathing accelerating in recognition. Rope skeleton expanding with excitement. It knows she fed the Bull. Final quarter: Sigrid, exactly 11 feet from MagnÃºs still, only one unsurprised. "HÃºsiÃ° valdi" she said. The house chose. Complete circle shows GuÃ°rÃºn at threshold - neither in nor out. House breathing 18/min around her, warming her, protecting. Her faldbÃºningur (ice crown or blood crown) begins melting, dripping. Each drop hisses on the 37Â°C floor. She's between two states: death pronouncement outside, life inside. The house choosing life.

Scene: Interior doorway, 10:18 AM. Family in positions. Temperature differential extreme. Dripping creating puddle.

Style: 360Â° around her showing all reactions (that's where the camera is), impossible survival documented.

Dialogue: (MagnÃºs): "ÃžÃš ÃTTIR AÃ DEYJA" (GuÃ°rÃºn, finally speaking): "HÃºsiÃ°... vildi ekki" (Sigrid): "Bergrisi valdi" (Giant chose)

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Dripping (water or blood), camera circling, house breathing fast] [AMBIENT: Family's disrupted breathing, tilberi's three rhythms, floor hissing from drops] [ABSENT: no natural explanation]

Visual Composition:

Circle reveals: Each family position
Dripping crown: Ice or blood melting
Threshold position: Between states
House protection: Warming, breathing
Puddle forming: Evidence of ordeal
Should I continue with the confrontation developing?
