Duration: 8 seconds
[STITCH from Shot 32: Underwater showing net with all fish]

Subject: [MAGNÃšS] pulling his line up, his 0Hz hands suddenly feeling the difference - not the darting tension of fish but the slow, industrial drag of net - as the trawler's engine rhythm changes from mechanical drone to something attentive, yellow lights swiveling to focus on his tiny boat.

Action: MagnÃºs pulls line with 0Hz hands (no tremor). First few pulls feel normal, then sensation changes - even without tremor feedback, his frozen nerves detect difference. Not quick fish-fight but steady, grinding resistance. Like pulling against machine. Looks down through clear water: sees the dark shadow of net below, his line disappearing into industrial mesh. Understands instantly. No fish free. All fish inside their net. His hook caught on their property. Rage builds but impotent - like mouse caught on elephant's foot. Across water, trawler's engine changes. Was steady 40Hz drone, now fluctuates: 40Hz... 35Hz... 45Hz... breathing rhythm. Yellow searchlights, which were sweeping mechanically, stop. Both lights swivel, lock onto his 12-foot boat. The empire notices the mouse. Trawler begins turning - not away but TOWARD him. Slow, deliberate, 200 feet of steel adjusting course to deal with 12 feet of wood. Distance: 300 meters. His line still caught, being dragged as net moves.

Scene: Surface of fjord, 9:15 AM but dark. Clear water showing net shadow below. Trawler dominant in frame, adjusting course. Mountains silent witnesses.

Style: MagnÃºs's POV seeing net below, then wide showing trawler turning toward him (that's where the camera is), documentary of power imbalance.

Dialogue: (MagnÃºs, realizing): "Ãžeirra net... allt Ã­ Ã¾eirra neti" (To trawler): "ÃžETTA ER MITT HAF!" (THIS IS MY SEA!) (Engine responding): Rhythm change audible

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Line dragging against net not fish, engine rhythm changing to attention, searchlights swiveling with mechanical grind] [AMBIENT: 0Hz hands feeling different tension, net dragging below, water lapping empty] [ABSENT: no fish sounds, no escape possible]

Technical (Negative Prompt): no subtitles, show realization clearly, trawler attention shift, documentary observation
