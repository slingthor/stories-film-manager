[STITCH from Shot 43c: Door closes, GuÃ°rÃºn in storm]

Subject: Camera spiraling around [GUÃRÃšN] as she stands in the storm, oil lamp flame horizontal in wind then dying, the moment of darkness triggering her first deep breath in years - visible as massive white cloud - finally alone, no one watching except us.

Action: CAMERA SPIRALS counterclockwise matching wind vortex. GuÃ°rÃºn holds lamp fragment, flame bending 90 degrees horizontal. First spiral: flame yellow, fighting. Second spiral: flame blue, shrinking. Her sealskin cloak whipping, revealing wool she pulled from wrists - now 25mm long, wrapped around fingers, already ice-covered. Third spiral: flame dies. Darkness except snow reflecting pre-dawn grey. But in darkness - her breathing changes. Deep inhale, visible as huge white cloud, held, released. First unobserved breath in years. No husband counting. No children needing. Face relaxes into something almost like peace. Wind creates snow spirals around her - five spirals with six intersection points, the pattern everywhere. Her first step: not toward sea but standing still, feeling solitude. FaldbÃºningur headdress collecting snow, becoming white crown.

Scene: Outside house, horizontal snow. Visibility 3 meters. Wind vortex creating natural spiral. -30Â°C visible in instant ice formation.

Style: Spiraling camera matching wind pattern, darkness when lamp dies (that's where the camera is), her liberation through solitude.

Dialogue: None - just breathing changing from controlled to free

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Wind at 90mph, lamp flame dying, her deep free breathing] [AMBIENT: Snow horizontal, house invisible already, spiral patterns] [ABSENT: no human sounds, alone]

Visual Composition:

Spiral movement: Camera and wind synchronized
Light death: Yellow â†’ blue â†’ dark
Breath visible: Massive cloud of liberation
Snow patterns: Five spirals, six points
FaldbÃºningur: Becoming ice crown
