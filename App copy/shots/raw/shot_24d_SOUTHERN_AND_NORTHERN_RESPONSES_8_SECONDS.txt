Subject: From south, the house itself responding as Bergrisi - floor suddenly warm and wet like flesh, walls breathing visibly, heartbeat racing through structure - while from north, a raven shadow passes the broken window, too large for any bird, wings spanning the entire house, leaving frost feathers on glass.

Action: Southern response: The floor beneath Sigrid becomes body-warm, 37Â°C exactly. Wet. Looking closer - not moisture but perspiration, house sweating. Walls flex inward-outward, no longer subtle but visible breathing at 4/min, dying rhythm. The three beams creak, bend, showing pink underneath bark for full second - ribs. Heartbeat through everything, 80bpm, panicking. House groaning at 16Hz, harmonizing with Sigrid's possessed voice: "Ã‰g er hÃ©r... Ã©g dey" (I am here... I'm dying) from the walls themselves. Northern response: Massive shadow across broken window. Raven but impossible size - wings would be 30 feet across. Shadow passes slowly, deliberately, examining house. Where shadow touches broken glass, black frost forms instantly - raven-feather patterns in ice. Shadow has substance, weight. As it passes, hundreds of normal ravens suddenly audible, circling above, cawing in unison. But shadow-raven silent. Through shadow, glimpse of eye - human eye, grey with amber flecks. Sigrid's exact eyes in raven form.

Scene: Interior revealing as body cavity. Floor wet with perspiration. Walls flexing. Massive shadow passing. All four cardinal directions now responding.

Style: Split frame - floor revealing as flesh, shadow passing above (that's where the camera is), documentary of complete summoning.

Dialogue: (House/Bergrisi): "Ã‰g er hÃ©r... Ã©g dey" (from walls) (Sigrid, breaking through): "Ã–ll fjÃ¶gur... Ã©g kallaÃ°i Ã¡ Ã¶ll" (All four... I called them all)

Sounds: [PRIMARY: House sweating and breathing, heartbeat 80bpm, massive wings passing] [AMBIENT: Hundreds of ravens above, walls groaning 16Hz, four responses overlapping] [ABSENT: no escape, surrounded]

Technical (Negative Prompt): no subtitles, show floor as flesh, shadow too large, documentary observation
