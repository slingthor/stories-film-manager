[STITCH from Shot 55b: Tail approaching head]

Subject: The trawler's bow opening impossibly wide - revealing rows of industrial teeth - and biting down on the massive tail, the moment of contact sending shockwave across fjord, through house, triggering the family's final transformation.

Action: Trawler's bow SPLITS. Not breaking - opening. Like mouth. Inside: rows of teeth. But industrial teeth - circular saws, grinding gears, metal fangs. Still trawler but also ancient mouth. Tail arrives at bow. Moment of hesitation. Then: BITE. Teeth pierce scales. Green-black blood explodes. Not just blood - oil, contamination, centuries of poison. Shockwave ripples outward. Hits house. Everything shakes. Family thrown to floor. But as they fall, they change. Mid-air transformation beginning. Hands becoming hooves. Faces elongating. But also NOT changing - were always both. Through window: trawler/serpent completing circle. Biting harder. Swallowing itself. Industrial capitalism consuming its own body. Circle getting smaller. Water inside circle dropping - whirlpool forming. Abyss opening. The end of one world. Beginning of another. Sigrid alone stands, black feather glowing. She doesn't transform. Yet.

Scene: Wide view of complete ouroboros. House shaking. Family falling/transforming. Apocalyptic moment.

Style: Wide to close on bite, shockwave through everything (that's where the camera is), RagnarÃ¶k documented.

Dialogue: (House/Bergrisi, dying scream): "NÃšNA!" (Family): Sounds between human and animal

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Industrial teeth biting scales, shockwave, whirlpool forming] [AMBIENT: House shaking apart, family transforming, abyss opening] [ABSENT: no human words anymore]
