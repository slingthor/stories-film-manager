SHOT 44c: WOOL BECOMES VISIBLE TRAIL (5 SECONDS)
Progressive State: Transformation evidence | Wool extending | Camera frost 31% | Becoming material | Watching: Trail witnesses
Women's Silence: Body speaking what voice won't
Triple Reality: Physical: wool growing | Psychological: accepting change | Mythological: thread of fate
Duration: 5 seconds
Camera Movement: Close tracking her hands as wool extends
[STITCH from Shot 44b: Walking spiral, creating sixth line]

Subject: Close tracking shot on [GUÃRÃšN]'s hands as she walks, wool from her wrists now continuously emerging - 30mm, 40mm, 50mm - leaving white thread trail in snow like Ariadne's thread, but leading to water not escape.

Action: CLOSE TRACKING on hands. Wool emerges continuously now, not pulled but growing. White fibers pushing through skin at 2mm per second, visible growth. No pain on her face - relief. Body becoming material, finally honest. Thread trails behind in snow, weaving between her footprints. Wind tries to lift thread, creates momentary spirals in air - fleeting sheep shapes, dissolving. At 50mm length, wool begins braiding itself, three strands twisting without her touching. Her wedding ring visible through wool wrapping - green oxidation from brass, not gold, poor woman's band. Hands aging visibly, veins prominent, skin thinning to translucence. Through translucent skin: dark shapes, might be bones, might be something else. Ahead through snow: sound of water, impossible in this cold. Polynya close.

Scene: Close on hands, snow background. Wool white against white, only movement visible. -30Â°C freezing wool as it emerges.

Style: Intimate tracking of transformation detail (that's where the camera is), body becoming honest.

Dialogue: None - transformation needs no words

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Wool emerging with soft stretch sound, thread trailing, braiding itself] [AMBIENT: Water ahead despite freeze, her breathing steady, wind decreasing] [ABSENT: no human intervention]

Visual Composition:

Macro detail: Wool through skin
Self-braiding: Automatic action
Thread trail: Path marked
Translucent skin: Internal shadows
Ring revealed: Poverty confirmed
Technical (Negative Prompt): maintain close focus, show growth clearly, no gore just transformation
