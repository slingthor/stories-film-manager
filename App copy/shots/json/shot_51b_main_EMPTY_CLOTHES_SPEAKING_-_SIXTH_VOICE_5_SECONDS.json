      "action": "PAN FROM children to corner. Empty clothes standing in human formation. MagnÃºs's sweater raises sleeve as if pointing. From inside, whisper emerges: \"En...\" GuÃ°rÃºn's spare dress responds: \"To...\" Back and forth, counting. But reaching seven: \"Syv?\" Family freezes. Who is seven? Empty clothes have been breathing at 8/min, now speaking. Not possessed - manifested. The sixth presence confirming itself. But suggesting seventh. Through fabric, shapes almost visible - not bodies but memory of bodies. The clothes remember wearing. Remember counting. Sigrid's spare dress stands apart, 11 feet from MagnÃºs's clothes, maintaining distance even empty. The whispers are in voices family recognizes but can't place. Their own voices from future? From past? MagnÃºs turns toward clothes: \"HvaÃ°?\" But clothes fall silent. Resume breathing only. But seven has been spoken.",
