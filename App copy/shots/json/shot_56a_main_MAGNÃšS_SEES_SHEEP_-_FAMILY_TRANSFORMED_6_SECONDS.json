      "action": "MAGNÃšS POV from floor level. Pushes up on elbows. Blinks. Where GuÃ°rÃºn fell: white ewe wearing faldbÃºningur headdress, standing on hind legs. Impossible. Beautiful. Horrible. Where JÃ³n fell: lamb with child's sweater, human teeth visible in sheep mouth. Where Lilja fell: smaller lamb, dress hanging wrong on wool body. All standing upright. Bipedal sheep. He laughs - harsh, breaking. \"Ã‰g er aÃ° missa vitiÃ°\" (I'm losing my mind). Stands. They watch him with horizontal-pupil eyes. GuÃ°rÃºn-ewe steps toward him, makes sound: \"Maaagnus\" - his name through sheep vocal cords. Horror. Truth. Both. He backs toward window. Sees reflection. Stops laughing. In glass: ram with curved horns. Wearing his clothes. That's HIM. Looks down at hands - still sees human hands. Looks at reflection - sees hooves. Both true simultaneously.",
