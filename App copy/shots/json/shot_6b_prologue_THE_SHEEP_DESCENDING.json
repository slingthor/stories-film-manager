      "action": "Sheep pour down three mountain paths simultaneously. White bodies against green slopes. Moving like liquid, flowing around rocks. No shepherds visible driving them. They know to come. Dogs at bottom wait but don't herd. Sheep converge on ancient stone pen - circular center with triangular sections radiating out. The pen ancient, stones worn smooth. People arrive from whale processing, from berry cooking. Still covered in three stains - red blood, purple juice, golden yolk. Take positions around pen. Each family at their traditional section. Sheep flow into central circle. Swirl clockwise. Perfect spiral. No commands given. First sheep enters family section on its own. Others follow. Each sheep knows its section. The pattern they make matches the bones children threw earlier. MagnÃºs stands at his family's gate. Watches sheep sort themselves. His shadow falls wrong direction - sun is west but shadow points east.",
