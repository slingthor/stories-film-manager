HANDHELD FOLLOWS him, unstable, threatening. Sigrid backs toward platform, maintaining 11 feet but running out of room. Black feather in her hand. He continues: \"GuÃ°rÃºn er veik. HÃºn deyr fljÃ³tlega.\" (GuÃ°rÃºn is weak. She dies soon.) \"ÃžÃº ert tilbÃºin. Ã‰g sÃ© Ã¾aÃ°.\" (You're ready. I see it.) Reaches for her. She presses against wall.
