      "action": "SLOW PUSH IN on GuÃ°rÃºn-ewe's head. FaldbÃºningur headdress - symbol of Icelandic womanhood, marriages, tradition - perched on sheep skull. Too wide for human head shape. Sliding forward over horizontal eyes. She tries to adjust it with hooves, can't. The white fabric against white wool makes her almost invisible - just eyes and headdress floating. Push closer: human teeth visible when she opens mouth to breathe. Dental work still there - one silver filling catching light. The ultimate perversion: cultural identity on livestock. She breathes at 11/min - the synchronized rate. Still controlled. Still administered. Danish colonialism made them animals wearing human costume. Now costume doesn't fit. Never did.",
