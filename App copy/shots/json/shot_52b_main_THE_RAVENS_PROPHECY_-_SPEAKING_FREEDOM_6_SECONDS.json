But also: Sigrid with black wings, flying over free Iceland. Both true. Raven continues: \"ÃžÃº ert vitni. ÃžÃº munt muna.\" (You are witness. You will remember.) Its wing extends toward her. One feather falls. Black, perfect, large as hand. Floats impossible slow. Sigrid catches it. Moment she touches: sees everything. The family as sheep below. MagnÃºs approaching her bed tonight. The house dying and rebirthing. The escape through transformation. Her belly quickens - baby responding to future mother's freedom. Raven speaks final words: \"En fyrst, Ã¾Ãº verÃ°ur aÃ° deyja sem Ã¾au\" (But first, you must die as them). Meaning: undergo transformation with family, but emerge different.",
