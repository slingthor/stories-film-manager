      "subject": "[MAGNÃšS] trudging through snow toward the overturned Ã¡rabÃ¡tur, his boots breaking through the crust to reveal underneath five perfect spirals of ram's blood frozen in ice, with six intersection points where the spirals meet - impossible geometry that's been here all along, waiting under fresh snow.",
      "action": "MagnÃºs walks toward boat, each step breaking through 3-inch snow crust. Crack. Dark underneath. Steps again. More darkness. Looks down: blood. Old blood, frozen black-red, in perfect spiral. Steps back, revealing pattern - five spirals radiating from house, each 10 feet diameter, meeting at six points though five spirals can only create five intersections. The blood from morning slaughter? From weeks ago? From years? Impossible to tell when frozen. He follows one spiral - it leads to Ã¡rabÃ¡tur. Boat sits at spiral center, covered in snow but underneath, blessed or cursed by blood geometry. He brushes snow off boat, revealing name \"Von\" (Hope) spelled in what might be paint or might be blood. Tremor at 4Hz makes his hands shake seeing it. Through window, family watching. Trawler beam sweeps across, illuminating blood patterns like landing lights for something. Ram tracks visible in blood, but walking on hind legs. Human footprints inside ram tracks. Both true. Neither true.",
      "scene": "Outside house, 6:26 AM, -25Â°C, breath freezing mid-air and falling as personal snow. Wind at 50mph but stopped in spiral centers - perfect stillness there. The blood patterns extending beyond visible range, maybe covering entire island. Snow 8 inches deep except over blood - only 3 inches there, as if blood generates heat. Mountains watching, echoing nothing.",
