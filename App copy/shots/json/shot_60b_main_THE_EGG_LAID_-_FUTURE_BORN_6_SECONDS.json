Translucent shell. Inside: human infant visible. Sleeping. Waiting. The bridge generation. Child who will be 24 in 1944. Will vote for independence. Will remember nothing of being in egg. But will dream of flying. Will fear enclosed spaces. Will love ravens inexplicably. PULL BACK reveals location: Reykjavik Cathedral, 1920. City smaller. Cleaner. Hopeful. Gammur perches on cross above. Guardian. Ensuring. The egg warm despite winter. Glowing slightly. Other ravens gathering. Protecting. They know what it contains. Who it contains. The future voter. The independence maker. The one who says \"jÃ¡\" (yes) to freedom.",
