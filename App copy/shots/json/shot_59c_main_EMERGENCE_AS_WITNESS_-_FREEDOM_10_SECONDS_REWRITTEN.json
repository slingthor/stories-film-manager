Seven ravens circling. But also seventy. Seven hundred. All depends on angle. They speak as one: \"Velkomin, Ãsland\" (Welcome, Iceland). She IS Iceland. The moment she emerges: obelisk ACTIVATES. Sends light beam straight up. Black light. Visible darkness. Signal to cosmos. The evolution moment. The independence beacon. Through light beam: glimpse of 1944. She's there. Old. Watching flags change. Remembering this moment. The egg inside her quickens. Will be laid in 1920. Will hatch human. The child who votes for independence. The cycle complete. Below in monument: family preserved. Eternal. Their sacrifice enabling this. She circles obelisk once. Sees them through glass. GuÃ°rÃºn-ewe nods through crystal. Permission. Blessing. Go. Remember. Tell. Fly.",
