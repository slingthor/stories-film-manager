His 0Hz hands clenching. She survived his death sentence. Second quarter: Children on floor, JÃ³n showing sheep teeth in relief smile, Lilja reaching toward mother but not moving from rÃ©ttir position. Third quarter: Tilberi at center, brass eye weeping green tears, three-rhythm breathing accelerating in recognition. Rope skeleton expanding with excitement. It knows she fed the Bull. Final quarter: Sigrid, exactly 11 feet from MagnÃºs still, only one unsurprised. \"HÃºsiÃ° valdi\" she said. The house chose. Complete circle shows GuÃ°rÃºn at threshold - neither in nor out. House breathing 18/min around her, warming her, protecting. Her faldbÃºningur (ice crown or blood crown) begins melting, dripping. Each drop hisses on the 37Â°C floor. She's between two states: death pronouncement outside, life inside. The house choosing life.",
