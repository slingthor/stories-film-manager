      "subject": "[MAGNÃšS] singing the Krummi lullaby in his deep baritone - the male version from opening - \"Krummi svaf Ã­ klettagjÃ¡,\" but from him it sounds like keeping her trapped, while through window an actual raven watches, knowing she's the Krummi he's singing about.",
      "action": "ROTATION BEGINS as he starts singing. Deep voice, genuinely beautiful: \"Krummi svaf Ã­ klettagjÃ¡, kaldri vetrarnÃ³ttu Ã¡.\" The male version we heard in opening, but now we see the singer. His hand moves from ankle to calf, still through blanket, stroking in rhythm with song. Not violent. Tender. Which makes it worse. \"VerÃ°ur margt aÃ° meini\" (Much becomes harmful) - as his hand rises slightly. \"Fyrr en dagur fagur rann\" - hand pauses at knee. She doesn't move. Can't. Where would she go? 40 miles to anyone. He's the only adult male. Father and future husband both. Rotation reveals window - raven sitting on sill, watching. The REAL Krummi seeing the girl who will become raven. MagnÃºs doesn't see it. Focused on Sigrid. \"Krummi, Krummi, krÃºnka nÃ¡Ã°u\" - but it sounds like keeping her, not calling. His 0Hz hands perfectly still on her knee. The tenderness and possession inseparable.",
