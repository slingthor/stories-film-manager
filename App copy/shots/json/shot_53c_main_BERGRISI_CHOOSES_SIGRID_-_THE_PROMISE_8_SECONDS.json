      "action": "House focuses on Sigrid. Different voice now - tender, paternal. \"ÃžÃš ERT ÃSLAND.\" MagnÃºs staggers back, hand leaving her shoulder. House protecting her. \"ÃžÃš MUNT LIFA.\" CRANE UP as ceiling above her platform begins cracking. Not collapsing - opening. Like flower blooming. Stars visible through widening gap. Cold air enters but doesn't touch her - house creates warm air bubble around her. \"VERTU KRUMMI.\" (Become raven.) The black feather in her hand begins glowing slightly. Through opening: seven ravens circling, waiting. The klettagjÃ¡ (rocky cleft) forming - her escape route. But also transformation site. MagnÃºs rages: \"NEI! HÃšN ER MÃN!\" Tries to grab her. Floor becomes liquid beneath him, swallows his feet to ankles. House holds him. Protects her. Loves her. She is Iceland. She will witness. She will escape. The ceiling continues opening - 3 feet wide now. Stars bright. Freedom visible.",
