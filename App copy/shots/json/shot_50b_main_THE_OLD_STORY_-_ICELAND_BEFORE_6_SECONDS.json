      "subject": "[MAGNÃšS] sitting on edge of [SIGRID]'s platform - boundary crossed but subtle - telling her stories of Iceland before Danish counting: \"Ãžegar viÃ° vorum frjÃ¡ls... Ã¾egar konur sungu\" (When we were free... when women sang), his hand on her ankle, possessive but gentle.",
      "action": "He sits. Not beside but ON her platform. She pulls knees up, maintaining distance even horizontal. But accepts - isolation means no one to say this is wrong. He tells old story: \"Fyrir DanmÃ¶rku, fyrir talningu...\" (Before Denmark, before counting...). Voice hypnotic, genuinely beautiful. The tremor gone (0Hz) makes him steady, reliable. \"Konur sungu Ã¾Ã¡. Allt var Ã¶Ã°ruvÃ­si.\" (Women sang then. Everything was different.) His hand finds her ankle through blanket. Just resting. Fatherly. But doesn't move away. PUSH IN reveals shadow on wall - shadow's hand much higher than ankle, near thigh. Shadow tells different story. \"ÃžÃº hefÃ°ir sungiÃ° Ã¾Ã¡, Sigrid. ÃžÃº hefÃ°ir veriÃ° frjÃ¡ls.\" (You would have sung then, Sigrid. You would have been free.) But his hand prevents freedom. The irony unconscious or deliberate? She breathes steady 15/min. Never changes. Even with his hand on ankle. Wall behind shows \"VITNI\" (witness) in cracks. She will witness all.",
