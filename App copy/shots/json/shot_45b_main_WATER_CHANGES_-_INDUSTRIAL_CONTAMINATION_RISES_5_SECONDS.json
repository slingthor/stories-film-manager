      "subject": "The polynya water changing as [GUÃRÃšN] works - oil sheens spreading in rainbow patterns, brass fixtures floating up from depths, rope fragments surfacing, the water itself becoming industrial soup while steam increases, bubbles starting from deep below.",
      "action": "Water transforms. First: oil sheen spreads from center, rainbow pattern on black. Not natural oil - machine oil, thick, viscous. Second: brass fixtures float up - bolts, rings, chain links - green with verdigris, some fused with flesh fragments. Third: rope pieces surface, but wrong - hemp grown through with veins, organic and industrial fused. Fourth: water color changes from black to black-green, contaminated. Fifth: bubbles begin from deep - not random but in pattern, breathing rhythm, 12 breaths per minute matching house. Each bubble brings up more contamination. GuÃ°rÃºn sees but continues gathering seaweed - what choice does she have? Wool from wrists touches water, immediately absorbs oil, turns grey-black. Steam thickens, visibility dropping. Something massive displacing water from below. Surface bulges slightly. Breathing bubbles increase. Water temperature rising - now 40Â°C, uncomfortable. Her hands red from heat, not cold.",
