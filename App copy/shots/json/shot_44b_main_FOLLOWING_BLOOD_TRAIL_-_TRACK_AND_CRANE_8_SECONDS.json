      "action": "TRACKING SHOT following 3 meters behind GuÃ°rÃºn. Her feet find MagnÃºs's path instinctively - boot prints filled with frozen blood from his nose, her smaller feet fitting inside like child in parent's steps. Wool from wrists leaves thread trail in snow. Each step breaks through crust, revealing older blood beneath - layers of history. Ram blood, human blood, ancient blood. All the same path. CAMERA BEGINS CRANING UP at 4 seconds, rising to 15 meters. Aerial view reveals: she's walking spiral pattern, but her path creates the sixth line that makes intersection points impossible. She IS the mathematical impossibility. Her faldbÃºningur from above looks like white bird against white ground - only dark spot is her face looking up, seeing camera, seeing us watching. Knows she's witnessed. Continues anyway.",
