      "subject": "[MAGNÃšS] opening the storage room door, revealing catastrophic emptiness - bare shelves, empty barrels, naked hooks where meat once hung - then reaching into his personal chest to retrieve wrapped harÃ°fiskur (dried fish) he's been hiding, eating it in full view of empty stores while his family starves.",
      "action": "MagnÃºs enters storage room, GuÃ°rÃºn following with hope. Camera reveals disaster: Twenty empty shelves with dust circles. Six barrels, all empty, one tipped showing mouse droppings but no mice (eaten). Empty hooks on beams where meat should hang, only rust stains. One sack of salt, nearly empty. Spider webs but no spiders (also eaten). Then MagnÃºs opens HIS chest - inside, wrapped in cloth: full piece of harÃ°fiskur, white with good fat, probably 3 days' food. He breaks off large piece, eats it standing among emptiness. GuÃ°rÃºn sees, her face cycling through betrayal, understanding, resignation. She counts the empty spaces - her lips moving \"einn, tveir, Ã¾rÃ­r...\" up to \"tuttugu og fjÃ³rir\" (twenty-four empty spaces). Behind them, JÃ³n appears in doorway, ribs visible through shirt, sees father eating, says nothing. MagnÃºs doesn't share, rewraps fish, hides it again. Looks at empty room, then to corner where fishing gear waits. The decision forming.",
      "scene": "Storage room, 6:12 AM, cold grey light through cracks. Temperature -12Â°C, colder than main room. Shelves floor to ceiling, all empty. The contrast between general emptiness and MagnÃºs's hidden plenty. His fishing gear in corner: line, hooks, gaff, net, old rifle - all prepared, waiting. Through door, family visible - Lilja gnawing thumb, Sigrid's hand on belly (feeding two), JÃ³n fevered and skeletal.",
