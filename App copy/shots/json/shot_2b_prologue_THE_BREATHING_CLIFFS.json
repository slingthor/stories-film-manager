      "action": "MagnÃºs leads up steep path, boots finding holds in dirt. JÃ³n follows 6 feet behind, smaller feet careful on loose stones. Path only 2 feet wide, cliff wall on right, drop on left. Seabirds cover every ledge - puffins with orange beaks, guillemots in rows, kittiwakes clustered. Birds shift as humans pass but don't fly. Too many birds - every square foot of cliff has nests. Path turns sharply. View opens showing full cliff height - 300 feet vertical black basalt columns. In cliff face, regular holes appear, 2 feet diameter, perfectly round. Some holes have golden light inside despite sun angle wrong. MagnÃºs's breathing steady. JÃ³n breathing harder, stops to rest. MagnÃºs waits without turning. Boy starts climbing again. Near path, eggs visible in nests - pure white, no spots, glowing faintly in shadow.",
