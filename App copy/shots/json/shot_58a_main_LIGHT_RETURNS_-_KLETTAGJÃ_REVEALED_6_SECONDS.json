      "action": "Light seeps in - not through windows but through rock. House IS rock now. CRANE UP slowly through transformed space. Walls no longer wood/turf but black volcanic stone. Cracks from earlier have become passages - five leading out, sixth blocked. The klettagjÃ¡ from lullaby, literal rocky cleft. But traces remain: doorframe still there but in stone. Hearth transformed to natural fire pit. The rÃ©ttir pattern in floor now carved in rock, ancient, permanent. Sheep family huddled center, still wearing torn human clothes. They look natural here. Like they belong. Cave sheep. Always were. Above: sky visible through massive opening. Dawn light entering. But also: seven ravens circling. Waiting. Through stone passages: glimpses of ocean, mountains, freedom. But sheep can't use passages. Too narrow for livestock. Only something smaller could escape. Something that could fly.",
