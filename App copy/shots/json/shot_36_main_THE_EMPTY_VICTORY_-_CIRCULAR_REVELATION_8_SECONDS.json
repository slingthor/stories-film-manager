      "subject": "Camera beginning tight on [MAGNÃšS]'s face then slowly pulling back while rotating 360Â° around his boat, revealing the complete emptiness of the fjord - no ships, no birds except seven ravens above, just poisoned green-black water stretching to every horizon, his face aging years in seconds as he comprehends his victory is absolute defeat.",
      "action": "CAMERA BEGINS on MagnÃºs's face in close-up - triumph draining to horror. PULLS BACK while starting clockwise rotation. First quarter turn: reveals his 0Hz hands still gripping useless rifle, two bullets remaining. Second quarter: shows poisoned wake, green-black trail 50 meters wide where trawler passed, water actually steaming toxic vapors. Third quarter: empty horizon toward house - tiny structure barely visible, smoke starting again but black now. Final quarter: completing circle to his face but WIDER now, showing him tiny in vast poisoned emptiness. During rotation, his face visibly ages - hair whitening at roots spreading outward, new lines carving deep, eyes sinking. Above, seven ravens maintain perfect spiral, their shadows on water creating mandala pattern. Through clear water between poison: seafloor visible, completely barren, trawl scars now filling with green-black contamination. The victory cost everything.",
