      "action": "WIDE SHOT of interior. MagnÃºs's hand on Sigrid's shoulder. Then: everything vibrates. 16Hz through structure - below human hearing, felt in bones, teeth, eyeballs. Words emerge from everywhere: \"Ã‰G ER BERGRISI.\" Not spoken but manifested. Dust cascades from ceiling, forming the letters briefly before dispersing. The three beams (ribs) flex visibly with each syllable. Floor becomes soft, warm, alive - exactly 37Â°C, body temperature. Windows fog instantly from house's breath. Everyone freezes. Even the tilberi stops its three-rhythm breathing. The empty clothes fall to ground like abandoned puppets. Only movement: dust letters forming and dissolving. \"Ã‰G... ER... BERGRISI.\" Each word makes the house more obviously body - walls perspiring, doorway like throat, smoke hole like nostril.",
