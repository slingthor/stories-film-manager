      "action": "Magnús pushes back from table, stands slowly. Height makes him tower over seated crowd. Picks up clay cup filled with purple krækilberjasaft. Liquid dark purple, almost black. Raises cup high. Everyone watches. Opens mouth. Lips form words. No sound emerges. Tries again. Mouth moves - can read lips saying 'Við erum...' (We are...). Still no sound. Face shows confusion, not fear. Not angry. Puzzled. Purple juice trembles in cup, small waves forming. Behind him, sun still frozen on horizon. Should have set hour ago. Magnús tries third time. This time faint sound emerges - not words, closer to sheep's bleat. Stops immediately. Looks at Guðrún. She nods encouragement. He sits down slowly, still holding cup. Everyone remains frozen, waiting for toast that won't come. In the purple juice, reflection shows not his face but wool. White wool.",
