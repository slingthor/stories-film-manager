FRAME 2 (1/24 second): But in single frame, lit by same candle: Five sheep standing on hind legs in exact positions. Magnús-ram with curved horns. Guðrún-ewe with faldbúningur perfectly placed on sheep head. Jón-lamb fevered, swaying. Lilja-lamb with doll. Sigrid-young ewe, belly slightly full, maintaining 11 feet. All have human teeth in sheep mouths. Wearing the family's clothes. FRAME 3 (1/24 second): Double exposure - both realities overlapping. Human forms transparent over sheep bodies. Sheep forms transparent over human bodies. Both true. Neither true. Candle dies. Darkness returns. Then through window - sweep of light. Industrial beam. Trawler.",
