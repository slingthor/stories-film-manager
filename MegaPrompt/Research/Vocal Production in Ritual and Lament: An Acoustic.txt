Vocal Production in Ritual and Lament: An Acoustic and Physiological Analysis for Sound Design
Section 1: The Sonic Architecture of Ritual and Lament: Cultural Frameworks for Extreme Vocalization
To effectively design the sound of invocations and emotional breakdowns, one must first understand that such vocalizations are not merely physiological reflexes but are profoundly shaped by cultural context. This section establishes the foundational principle that extreme vocal expression is a form of structured, meaningful cultural practice. It provides a conceptual toolkit for understanding the function and form of these sounds, moving beyond simple emotional labels to appreciate their role in mediating human experience.

1.1 The Soundscape as Cultural System: Introducing Sonic Ethnography

The field of sound studies, an interdisciplinary domain drawing from anthropology and ethnomusicology, provides a critical framework for this analysis. It posits that sound is not a universal constant but is produced, perceived, and interpreted within specific cultural contexts. A key concept is the "soundscape," a term that describes the total acoustic environment of a particular place or community, including its music, noise, and silence. Within any given soundscape, a society develops a unique "auditory culture"—a set of practices and values related to sound and listening.   

This leads to the concept of "acoustemology," a sonic way of knowing and making sense of the world. For groups like the Kaluli of Papua New Guinea, sound is fundamental "to making sense, to knowing, to experiential truth". In this view, sound is not simply a reflection of culture; it is an active agent that    

produces social and environmental patterns. Ritual vocalizations, therefore, are not just expressions of internal states but are technologies for shaping reality, creating community, and defining cultural identity. Understanding this function is paramount for creating a sound design that feels authentic and purposeful rather than merely decorative or illustrative.   

1.2 Case Study in Formalized Grief: The Practice of Keening

A powerful model for designing the sound of a profound emotional breakdown, such as that of the character Magnús, can be found in the traditional Gaelic practice of keening (caoineadh). Far from being chaotic wailing, keening is a highly structured yet emotionally raw form of lament for the dead, historically practiced in Ireland and Scotland.   

The vocal techniques of keening reveal a sophisticated approach to expressing grief. The performance is rhythmically free, without a strict meter, allowing the vocalization to follow the natural, disrupted cadence of sorrow and breathlessness. A central feature is the improvisation of text; rather than reciting a fixed song, the keener works within a shared body of poetic motifs, such as praising the deceased or lamenting the state of the bereaved. This improvisational framework is punctuated by the use of non-lexical vocables—sounds without semantic meaning like "ullaloo" or "óchón"—which serve as a direct conduit for raw, pre-linguistic emotion.   

The melodic contour of a keen is particularly instructive. Historical recordings and descriptions suggest a characteristic arc, often beginning as a low "purring" in the chest or throat and rising gradually to the highest treble. This provides a clear dynamic and pitch trajectory for a performance of breakdown, moving from internal, rumbling sorrow to an externalized, piercing cry. Furthermore, the keen possesses a formal structure, often comprising three parts: the salutation (introduction), the dirge (verse), and the    

gol (cry). This structure demonstrates that even the most intense grief can be articulated through a formal progression, providing a template for pacing a scene of emotional collapse. Finally, keening was a deeply embodied act, accompanied by physical movements like rocking, kneeling, and even banging on the coffin, underscoring the inseparable link between the voice and the body in the expression of profound loss.   

1.3 Case Study in Ecstatic Utterance: Glossolalia and Trance Vocalizations

For the design of invocations, an analysis of glossolalia, or "speaking in tongues," provides an invaluable acoustic and phonetic framework. Glossolalia is a nonordinary speech behavior found in numerous religious communities, characterized by the fluid vocalizing of speech-like syllables that lack any readily comprehended meaning. It is a form of ecstatic utterance often associated with trance states and a perceived connection to the divine.   

Crucially, acoustic and linguistic analyses reveal that glossolalia is not random babbling but a phonologically structured vocalization. Speakers unconsciously draw from the inventory of consonants and vowels of their native language, rearranging them into novel, word-like combinations. This phonetic limitation ensures the utterance sounds "language-like" and avoids true randomness. Unlike the free rhythm of keening, glossolalia is often characterized by a highly regular, repetitive, and sometimes staccato rhythm. This rhythmic regularity is a key component of its trance-inducing quality.   

Furthermore, glossolalic utterances exhibit realistic intonational contours, with patterns of accent, rhythm, and pitch that create discernible "word-like and sentence-like units". Phonetic analysis of recorded glossolalia reveals a consistent dynamic arc within phrases: a threshold of onset, a brief rising gradient of intensity, a peak, and a final, often precipitous, decay. This structured, cyclical pattern of intensity provides a clear blueprint for the performance and processing of an invocation. Neurological studies support this, showing that during glossolalia, activity in the brain's language centers decreases, suggesting a shift from conscious, semantic speech production to a more automatic, pattern-based vocalization driven by subcortical structures.   

A consistent pattern emerges from these disparate cultural practices: vocalizations of extreme emotion, far from being random, adhere to an underlying structure. The human mind, even in states of emotional overload or trance, imposes a pattern on vocal output. The perceived "loss of control" is not an absolute descent into chaos but a shift from semantic, syntactical control to a more primal, pattern-based control—be it the melodic motifs of keening, the phonetic repetition of glossolalia, or the rhythmic pulse of chanting. This provides a clear directive for sound design. Magnús's breakdown should not be a monotonous scream but should evolve to incorporate a repetitive vocal motif—a specific sob pattern or a phrase fragment that becomes a "grief mantra." Similarly, the invocations should be built around a core rhythmic and phonetic pattern, creating a bespoke ritual language that feels intentional and powerful, not arbitrary.

1.4 The Shamanic Voice: Incantation and Rhythmic Entrainment

Building upon the analysis of glossolalia, the study of shamanic chanting offers further insight into the deliberate use of vocal patterns to induce and sustain altered states of consciousness, a primary function of invocation. Across a vast range of cultures, chanting is a form of rhythmic, repetitive vocalization used to induce mystical states, facilitate healing, and connect with non-ordinary realities.   

The power of these incantations lies in their vibrational and rhythmic properties. The repetitive nature of the chant helps to calm the mind, reduce stress, and focus attention, synchronizing the energies of participants in a group setting. This process, known as rhythmic entrainment, can synchronize bodily rhythms and even affect brainwave patterns, leading to profound psychological and spiritual experiences. The sonic characteristics are paramount; specific mantras, such as the Sanskrit "Om," are designed to resonate with specific frequencies, and the act of humming or sustained toning can stimulate the vagus nerve, which in turn promotes relaxation by activating the parasympathetic nervous system. The focus is on the sonic texture, the rhythmic pulse, and the physical sensation of vibration, which often supersede any semantic meaning the words may or may not have.   

Section 2: The Physiology of the Voice Under Duress: From Internal State to Acoustic Signal
To sonically construct an authentic vocal breakdown or a powerful invocation, it is essential to understand the biological mechanics that translate an internal state into an external sound. This section deconstructs the physiological chain of events, from a neurological trigger to the muscular response of the vocal apparatus, providing the scientific rationale for the specific acoustic markers of duress that will be detailed in the subsequent section.

2.1 The Neuro-Vocal Connection: The Brain-Larynx Axis

The production of emotional vocalization begins in the brain. The limbic system, the master of emotions, communicates directly with the nerves that control the larynx. When an individual experiences extreme emotion or stress, the central nervous system (CNS) and autonomic nervous system (ANS) are activated. The ANS response, often termed "fight or flight," triggers a cascade of physiological changes, including increased heart rate, altered respiration, and significant muscle tension throughout the body.   

These changes are not abstract; they have a direct and measurable impact on the vocal production system. The muscles of the larynx and the respiratory system are innervated by a complex network of nerves, with the vagus nerve playing a crucial role in interconnecting stress responses, breathing, and speech. This integrated "neurovisceral" network means that a state of high arousal is not just a feeling but a physical event that fundamentally alters the conditions under which the voice is produced.   

2.2 Phonation Under Pressure: The Vocal Folds in Extremis

The larynx, and specifically the vocal folds, are the epicenter of these physiological changes. The quality, pitch, and stability of the voice are determined by the precise physical state of the vocal folds during phonation. Under duress, these parameters are radically altered.

Stiffness and Tension: High-arousal states like anger, fear, and panic cause the intrinsic laryngeal muscles (primarily the cricothyroid and thyroarytenoid) to contract. This action stretches the vocal folds, making them longer, thinner, and stiffer. Just as tightening a guitar string raises its pitch, this increase in longitudinal tension is the primary physiological mechanism responsible for the significant rise in fundamental frequency (   

F 
0
​	
 ), or pitch, observed in screams and cries of distress.   
Medial Surface Thickness: The vertical thickness of the vocal folds is a key determinant of vocal quality. Thicker vocal folds allow for a longer "closed quotient"—the proportion of each vibratory cycle where the folds are pressed firmly together. This long closed phase builds up subglottal pressure more effectively and leads to a strong excitation of higher-order harmonics, resulting in a rich, resonant, and "pressed" sound. Conversely, thin vocal folds may not close completely, allowing air to leak through, which results in a breathy, noisy sound with a weak harmonic structure. Emotional states can influence this thickness, thereby shaping the core timbre of the voice.   

Adduction: Vocal fold adduction refers to the force with which the folds are brought together at the midline. Emotions like anger are associated with increased adduction, where the folds are squeezed together more tightly. This creates a tense, non-breathy, and often loud vocal quality, as the folds offer greater resistance to the airflow from the lungs.   
2.3 The Breath of Emotion: Subglottal Pressure and Respiratory Patterns

The voice is an aerodynamic phenomenon, powered by the controlled exhalation of air from the lungs. Extreme emotional states profoundly disrupt this power source. The primary driver for increased vocal intensity (loudness) is an increase in subglottal pressure—the air pressure built up beneath the closed vocal folds. The explosive release of this pressure is what creates a loud sound. Therefore, the physiology of a scream or a shout is fundamentally tied to the respiratory system's ability to generate immense subglottal pressure.   

However, states of high distress, particularly grief, are also characterized by a loss of respiratory control. This leads to irregular breathing, audible gasps (ingressive phonation), sobbing, and shorter speech periods between breaths. These respiratory disruptions are not merely side effects; they are integral acoustic components of a voice in distress, directly impacting the temporal rhythm and continuity of the vocalization.   

The vocal production system under duress can be understood as a system in a state of cascade failure. The demand for loudness requires a massive increase in subglottal pressure from the lungs. This pressure, however, threatens to blow the vocal folds apart, forcing the laryngeal muscles to dramatically increase tension and adduction to maintain phonation. This extreme muscular tension inevitably raises the pitch. This entire high-stakes balancing act is fueled by chaotic, inefficient breathing patterns. The characteristic "break" in a voice under extreme strain is the acoustic artifact of this system failing—the moment when subglottal pressure momentarily overwhelms laryngeal control, when muscles fatigue and cause tension to fluctuate wildly, or when the need for oxygen forces an involuntary gasp. An authentic vocal breakdown must sonically represent this system failure. It cannot be a simple, sustained loud, high-pitched tone. It must include the artifacts of the physiological struggle: sudden drops into vocal fry (laryngeal fatigue), moments of breathiness or complete aphonia (a failure of adduction), sharp, audible gasps for air (respiratory disruption), and distorted vowel sounds resulting from extreme pharyngeal tension. These are the sounds of the vocal machine being pushed beyond its operational limits.   

Section 3: An Acoustic Lexicon of Extreme Emotion: Translating Physiology into Sound Waves
This section provides the core technical data of the report, translating the physiological changes detailed in Section 2 into a lexicon of measurable acoustic parameters. This analysis serves as a direct bridge between the biological reality of vocal production and the practical tools of sound design, offering a quantitative basis for performance, recording, and post-production decisions.

3.1 Mapping Emotion in Acoustic Space: Key Parameters

Acoustic analysis quantifies the sound wave produced by the voice, allowing for an objective description of its characteristics. These characteristics can be grouped into three main categories:

Prosodic Features: These relate to the melody, rhythm, and loudness of speech over longer segments like words and sentences. The primary measures are fundamental frequency (F 
0
​	
 ), which corresponds to perceived pitch; intensity, which corresponds to perceived loudness; and duration/speech rate.   
Voice Quality Features: These describe the texture and stability of the voice at a micro-level, reflecting the regularity of vocal fold vibration. Key measures include jitter, the cycle-to-cycle variation in frequency (pitch perturbation); shimmer, the cycle-to-cycle variation in amplitude (loudness perturbation); and the Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio (HNR), which quantifies the amount of periodic (harmonic) sound versus aperiodic (noise) sound in the voice signal. A low HNR indicates a breathy or hoarse voice.   
Spectral Features: These describe the timbral quality of the voice, determined by how the vocal tract shapes the sound produced by the vocal folds. Key measures include formant frequencies, which are resonant peaks in the spectrum that determine vowel identity, and spectral tilt or spectral energy distribution, which describes the balance between low-frequency and high-frequency energy and corresponds to perceived brightness or darkness.   
3.2 The Acoustics of Rage and Breakdown (High Arousal, Negative Valence)

The voice in a state of rage or acute stress exhibits a distinct and powerful acoustic signature, driven by the physiological state of high sympathetic arousal.

Prosody: Research consistently associates anger with an elevated mean F 
0
​	
 , a wider F 
0
​	
  range, significantly increased intensity/volume, and a faster speech rate.   
Voice Quality: The extreme muscular tension and high subglottal pressure can lead to instability in vocal fold vibration, potentially increasing jitter and shimmer. The HNR is likely to decrease as turbulent airflow and aperiodic vibration introduce noise into the signal.   
Spectrum: Rage is characterized by a significant shift of energy into the higher frequencies, creating a perceptually "brighter," "sharper," or more strident sound. This is reflected in a steeper spectral tilt. Vowel formants are often displaced to more extreme positions in the vowel chart, indicating a kind of hyper-articulation that makes vowels more distinct.   
3.3 The Acoustics of Grief and Lament (High Arousal, Negative Valence with Low Arousal elements)

The acoustic profile of grief is more complex than that of rage, often blending signs of high arousal (distress) with physiological exhaustion.

Prosody: Grief-related vocalizations are often characterized by a high mean F 
0
​	
 , but this pitch is highly unstable, with frequent and uncontrolled shifts, colloquially known as the voice "breaking" or "cracking". While moments of wailing may be rapid, the overall speech rate tends to be slower, fragmented, and punctuated by sobs, pauses, and audible gasps (ingressive phonation).   
Voice Quality: The instability of the grieving voice makes it a prime candidate for high jitter and shimmer values, which are the acoustic measurements of this "breaking" or "trembling" quality. The HNR is typically low, reflecting both the breathiness of sobbing and the introduction of noise from turbulent airflow and irregular phonation.   
Spectrum: The sound of grief is often associated with pharyngealization—a tense, constricted sound produced by tension in the throat muscles. Acoustically, this corresponds to a centralization of vowel formants. Unlike the hyper-articulation of rage, the vowels in a grieving voice become less distinct and "muddled" as they shift towards the center of the vowel space.   
3.4 The Acoustics of Invocation and Ecstasy (High Arousal, Variable Valence)

The vocalizations associated with trance and ecstatic states, such as glossolalia and ritual chanting, have a unique acoustic profile that reflects a state of altered consciousness rather than emotional breakdown.

Prosody: The defining characteristic is a strong rhythmic and intonational pattern. Pitch and intensity follow a clear, often cyclical contour of onset, rise, peak, and decay, which is repeated to create a hypnotic effect. The delivery is typically fluid and can be quite rapid.   

Voice Quality: Because this is often a state of controlled "flow" rather than physiological struggle, jitter and shimmer may be relatively low and stable within the rhythmic phrases, indicating a controlled, albeit automatic, mode of vocal production.   
Spectrum: The phonetic content is limited, drawing from the speaker's native phonemic inventory but rearranged into repetitive, non-semantic syllables. These sequences often feature high incidences of alliteration, assonance, and repetition of specific phonetic patterns (e.g., [ʃ:əlaɾalaɾa]).   
The acoustic analyses of rage and grief reveal a powerful diagnostic opposition. Rage is characterized by a spectral expansion: vowels become more distinct and move to the extremes of the acoustic space, and energy shifts into higher frequencies. This is the sound of a system broadcasting its state with maximum clarity and power. Grief, conversely, is characterized by a spectral constriction: vowels become muddled and centralized, and the sound is shaped by a tense, pharyngeal quality. This is the sound of a system turning inward and choking on its own distress. This acoustic binary provides a clear and potent strategy for sound design. To sonically represent rage, processing should enhance clarity and high-frequency energy. To represent grief, processing should constrict the sound and smear the spectral details. This opposition can be used to dynamically chart a character's emotional journey from one state to the other.

Section 4: Sound Design Strategies for Invocation and Breakdown: From Theory to Application
This final section translates the preceding ethnographic, physiological, and acoustic analysis into a practical, actionable guide for the sound designer. It provides specific techniques for performance direction, recording, and post-production processing, grounding each creative choice in the scientific and cultural principles established throughout this report.

4.1 Performance and Recording for Authenticity

The foundation of a powerful vocal sound design is an authentic performance. Post-production can enhance, but rarely create, the visceral reality of a voice under duress.

Directing Talent: To elicit an authentic performance, direction should focus on the physiological drivers of emotion rather than the abstract feeling itself. For Magnús's breakdown, the actor should be guided through the physical process of respiratory disruption: taking sharp, uncontrolled gasps, holding the breath to build pressure, and allowing the voice to "break" or fatigue on the exhale. This focus on the physical act of breathing is more likely to produce the desired acoustic artifacts than simply asking for "sadness" or "anger". For the invocations, the focus should be on rhythm and repetition. The actor can be encouraged to repeat a simple phrase or set of syllables until the vocalization becomes automatic and less consciously articulated, mimicking the process that leads to trance states.   
Microphone Technique: Capturing the full detail of these performances requires careful microphone selection and placement. A dual-mic setup is recommended: a large-diaphragm condenser microphone placed relatively close to the actor will capture the intimate details of the voice—glottal clicks, mouth sounds, the wetness of a sob, and the high-frequency harmonics of a scream. Simultaneously, a microphone placed further back in the room will capture the overall acoustic energy and the sense of physical exertion in a real space. Recording at a high sample rate (e.g., 96 kHz or 192 kHz) is crucial, as it provides greater resolution for extreme pitch shifting and time stretching in post-production without introducing unwanted digital artifacts.   
4.2 Designing the Invocations: Crafting the "Otherworldly"

The goal for the invocations is to create a sound that feels structured, powerful, and transcendent, drawing from the acoustic principles of glossolalia and shamanic chanting.

Core Performance and Layering: The design should be built around a clean, rhythmic chant performance. This core track can then be augmented through layering. Duplicating the main vocal and creating additional layers—one pitched down an octave, another pitched up a fifth, and another consisting only of whispers following the same rhythm—can add immense depth and harmonic complexity without obscuring the core performance.   
Processing: The processing should aim to create a sense of ritual space and otherworldly resonance.

Reverb and Delay: Rather than a generic digital reverb, using convolution reverb with impulses captured in resonant, real-world spaces (e.g., a cathedral, a cave, a large stone hall) can place the voice in a tangible, sacred-sounding environment. Rhythmic delays, timed precisely to the tempo of the chant, will enhance its hypnotic, entraining quality.   

Modulation: To give the voice a non-human or super-human quality, subtle modulation effects are highly effective. A slow-moving frequency shifter, a gentle flanger, or an automated formant filter can create the impression that the voice is resonating with an unseen force or that the very air in the space is vibrating in sympathy with the invocation.   
4.3 Designing Magnús's Final Breakdown: Engineering a Collapse

Designing the sound of Magnús's breakdown requires a dynamic approach that sonically represents the "system cascade failure" of his vocal apparatus as he transitions between rage and grief.

Editing the Performance: The first step is to edit the recorded takes, compiling the most raw and visceral moments. It is critical to resist the urge to "clean up" the performance. The audible gasps, glottal fry from vocal fatigue, and moments of breathiness are not flaws; they are the sonic evidence of physiological reality and must be preserved.   
Processing for Rage: To capture the acoustic signature of rage, processing should focus on intensity, sharpness, and instability.

Dynamics and Distortion: Heavy compression can be used to manage the extreme dynamic range between whispers and screams. To maintain impact, the compressor's threshold can be automated to allow the initial transient of a scream to pass through before clamping down. Subtle saturation or bit-crushing can be applied to introduce harmonic distortion, emulating the increase in acoustic noise (decreased HNR) that occurs during high-pressure phonation.   
Equalization (EQ): To reflect the spectral shift associated with rage, the EQ should emphasize high-mid frequencies (2–5 kHz) and high frequencies (above 8 kHz). This will increase the perceived sharpness and aggression of the voice.   
Processing for Grief: To sonically represent the constricted, breaking quality of grief, the processing should focus on instability and timbral manipulation.

Pitch and Formants: Pitch correction tools like Melodyne or Auto-Tune can be used creatively not to perfect the pitch, but to introduce artifacts. Forcing the software to track a wildly unstable performance can create the unnatural, rapid pitch shifts that emulate the "breaking" voice (high jitter). Formant shifting plugins can be used to "smear" the vowels together, reducing their clarity and simulating the sound of a constricted pharynx, as seen in the acoustic data for grief.   
Layering with Non-Human Elements: A highly effective technique borrowed from creature sound design is to subtly blend manipulated non-human sounds into the human performance. The tail end of a human scream can be crossfaded into the pitched-down squeal of a pig or the cry of a fox. This creates a deeply unsettling psychoacoustic effect, making the human distress sound primal and terrifying.   

Reverb Automation: As demonstrated in the sound design for Hereditary, automating the reverb can powerfully reflect a character's psychological state. During the breakdown, the reverb can shift from a dry, intimate setting to a vast, cavernous one, sonically isolating the character and amplifying their sense of desolation.   
4.4 The Psychoacoustic Impact: Synthesis and Recommendations

The most effective and memorable vocal sound design, from the demonic possession in The Exorcist to the familial horror of Hereditary, operates on a principle of hybrid realism. The foundation of the sound is an authentic human performance, grounded in the physiological and acoustic realities explored in this report. The "design" component comes from the careful, often subtle, augmentation of that reality with layers of processed or non-human sound. This approach creates a psychoacoustic conflict for the listener: the sound is recognizably human, eliciting empathy, but it contains elements that are fundamentally "other" or "wrong," generating profound unease and horror.   

Therefore, the master strategy for both the invocations and Magnús's breakdown is to anchor every designed sound in a real, visceral performance. For the breakdown, the actor's genuine sobs, screams, and gasps are the core emotional truth. The design layers—the pitch artifacts, the animalistic sweeteners, the shifting reverbs—should be treated as enhancements that elevate this reality into the realm of cinematic horror, rather than replacing it. For the invocations, the rhythmic, embodied chant is the anchor. The reverbs, delays, and modulations are the sacred space it consecrates. This hybrid-realism approach ensures the final sound design is not merely a collection of effects, but a narratively coherent and psychologically devastating auditory experience.
