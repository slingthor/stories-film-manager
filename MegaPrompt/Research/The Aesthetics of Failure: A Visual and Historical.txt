The Aesthetics of Failure: A Visual and Historical Vocabulary of Digital Decay, from Glitch Art to AI Degradation
Part I: The Philosophy and Provenance of Digital Decay
1.1 Deconstructing Decay: From Entropy to Aesthetics

The digital realm, often perceived as an eternal and incorruptible archive, is in fact defined by a persistent and pervasive state of decay. Digital decay refers to the gradual degradation, obsolescence, or corruption of digital data and assets. This phenomenon is not an occasional flaw but a fundamental condition of our modern information ecosystem, stemming from the fragile infrastructure that underpins much of the internet. Evidence of this fragility is widespread; research indicates that nearly 40% of webpages that existed a decade ago are no longer accessible, a process that erodes our collective knowledge and creates gaps in our cultural and historical records. The constant churn of link rot, format obsolescence, and hardware failure means that digital information is inherently impermanent.   

This reality of digital impermanence has given rise to an artistic sensibility that challenges conventional notions of beauty. The aesthetics of decay find value not in perfection, symmetry, and order, but in the imperfect, the weathered, and the aged. This perspective, which has deep roots in art and architectural history, celebrates the "ravages of time" and the "mutability of materials". It aligns with philosophical concepts such as the Japanese principle of    

Wabi-Sabi, which finds beauty in impermanence, incompleteness, and the transient state of existence. In the context of digital art, this philosophy manifests as a direct challenge to our perceptions of permanence in the digital age. It proposes that the act of destruction—the glitch, the error, the corruption—can add aesthetic value rather than detract from it, exposing new visual experiences where decomposition and creation are intertwined.   

A crucial distinction must be made between the degradation of analog media and the decay of digital files, as their material differences produce entirely distinct aesthetics. Analog media, such as VHS tapes or vinyl records, degrade through a process of gradual, continuous signal loss known as generation loss. Each copy or playback introduces more noise, resulting in a slow fade into visual or auditory fuzziness, sputtering, and softness. The decay is entropic; the signal weakens gracefully, and while quality diminishes, the content often remains partially intelligible. This process gives rise to a "warm," nostalgic aesthetic, which scholars have termed the "aesthetics of remanence"—a cultural fondness for the material traces of magnetic tape's gradual memory loss.   

Digital decay, in stark contrast, is characterized by abrupt and catastrophic failure. Digital information is binary; data is represented by discrete 1s and 0s, meaning a file is either rendered perfectly or it is broken. The degradation, known as "bit rot," does not manifest as a gentle fade but as jarring visual artifacts: sharp-edged blocks, sudden color shifts, garbled data, or the complete inability to access the file. This "cliff-edge" failure is not a process of subtraction but of misinterpretation. The system does not receive a weaker signal; it receives incorrect data and attempts to execute its logical instructions anyway, resulting in a uniquely computational aesthetic of failure. This distinction is paramount; while analog decay evokes a sense of time passing, digital decay reveals the underlying logic of a system trying, and failing, to process faulty information.   

This very disembodiment and perceived perfection of digital media has led to a curious cultural phenomenon known as "analog nostalgia". Digital artists and filmmakers often intentionally simulate the aesthetics of analog decay—TV snow, VHS tracking errors, film grain—within their pristine digital productions. This act of remediation reflects a cultural longing for the perceived physicality and tangible "body" of obsolete media in an era dominated by virtual, placeless information.   

The technical fragility of digital information intersects with a broader epistemological crisis. The passive decay of our digital archives through link rot and bit rot is now compounded by the active pollution of the information ecosystem with AI-generated content, a process termed "internet poisoning". As large language models are trained on internet data, they absorb and replicate its biases and inaccuracies, then output new content that is fed back into the ecosystem, creating a cycle that can degrade the reliability of our shared knowledge base. This dual threat—archives rotting from below while being contaminated from above—fosters a "decrease in trust in information" and creates significant "gaps in public knowledge". Within this context, the artistic embrace of digital decay can be seen as a critical cultural response. By intentionally making the fragility, fallibility, and constructed nature of digital media visible, glitch art performs a necessary critique of our misplaced faith in digital permanence and neutrality.   

1.2 Pre-Digital Glitches: A Genealogy of Controlled Failure

While inextricably linked to modern technology, glitch art is not a spontaneous invention of the digital age. It belongs to a rich artistic lineage of avant-garde movements that sought to subvert norms, embrace chance, and challenge the very definition of art. The philosophical groundwork was laid in the early 20th century by movements that celebrated randomness and the irrational. Dadaism and Surrealism, with their embrace of the nonsensical and their use of "chance operations," provided a conceptual framework for finding meaning in the accidental. This spirit of controlled chaos is evident in the literary "cut-up" technique of William S. Burroughs, who would physically cut and randomly rearrange texts to create new, non-linear narratives—a direct analog to the digital reordering of data that would come decades later.   

This re-evaluation of what constitutes artistic material extended to the auditory realm. The Italian Futurist Luigi Russolo, in his 1913 manifesto "The Art of Noises," argued for the incorporation of the sounds of the industrial city into music, pioneering an appreciation for non-traditional, often harsh, sounds. Later, the composer John Cage would radicalize this idea, employing chance operations to compose music and famously challenging the boundary between sound and silence with his piece    

4'33". By framing the ambient "noise" of the concert hall as the music itself, Cage prefigured the glitch artist's embrace of unwanted signals and systemic interference.   

The most direct precursor to the visual language of glitch art emerged with the birth of video art, pioneered by Nam June Paik. Paik's explicit goal was to demystify television, to seize it from its corporate purveyors and transform it from a passive medium of mass consumption into a dynamic canvas for artistic expression. He famously declared his desire "to shape the TV screen canvas as precisely as Leonardo, as freely as Picasso". His 1965 work,    

Magnet TV, stands as a seminal moment in this project and a foundational piece for the glitch aesthetic. In this piece, Paik placed a powerful industrial magnet on top of a television set, allowing viewers to physically manipulate its magnetic field. This intervention directly distorted the television's electronic signals, warping the broadcast image into fluid, abstract, and ever-changing patterns. This was not a depiction of an error; it was the creation of an error as an aesthetic event. By subverting the intended use of the technology, Paik revealed its material properties—the flow of electrons, the cathode ray tube—and established a core principle of glitch art: the creative misuse of technology to expose its inner workings.   

This history reveals a direct conceptual lineage from early 20th-century physical art practices to contemporary digital techniques. The avant-garde art technique of décollage, for example, involves creating an image by "cutting, tearing away or otherwise removing, pieces of an original image". This act of forced entropy and decay compels the viewer to mentally reconstruct the whole from its fragmented remains. Decades later, the digital technique of datamoshing would emerge, which involves the deliberate "removal of an encoded video's I-frames" (the keyframes that contain full picture information). The result is that the subsequent frames, which only contain data about motion and change, are applied to a non-existent reference, causing the previous scene's pixels to smear across the new one. Datamoshing is, in essence, a form of digital    

décollage. The artist is not adding noise but is algorithmically tearing away the structural components of the video file, leaving the remaining data fragments to be interpreted in a new, chaotic context. This connection reframes a seemingly modern digital effect as the continuation of a long-standing artistic strategy of creative destruction.

1.3 The Birth of the Digital Glitch: System Critiques and Post-Digital Consciousness

The formal emergence of glitch art as a self-aware movement coincided with the rise of personal computing and the internet. While early pioneers of computer-generated art like Georg Nees and Vera Molnar had explored algorithmic aesthetics and randomness in the 1960s and 70s, their work was not intentionally focused on error. Similarly, the Demoscene of the 1980s, a subculture dedicated to pushing computer hardware to its absolute limits to create impressive audiovisual presentations, laid important cultural groundwork but did not yet constitute a glitch art movement.   

It was in the 1990s, with the advent of the World Wide Web, that artists began to use the network itself as their medium, giving rise to net.art. Central to this movement was the art collective JODI, formed by Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans. Their work is foundational to glitch art's history. Their website,    

wwwwwwwww.jodi.org (1995), famously confronted visitors with what appeared to be a mess of malfunctioning code and broken layouts. In reality, it was a meticulously crafted artwork that exposed the underlying HTML structure of the webpage, turning the normally invisible language of the web into the aesthetic object itself. By deconstructing the languages of new media and subverting user expectations, JODI's work serves as a powerful critique of the relationship between technology and its users, challenging the conventions of digital interfaces that are designed to be seamless and opaque.   

By the late 2000s, the movement began to develop a robust theoretical framework, largely through the work of Dutch artist and theorist Rosa Menkman. Her 2009    

Glitch Studies Manifesto is a seminal text that provides the movement with its philosophical underpinnings. In it, Menkman argues against the "ill-fated dogma" of the search for a "noiseless channel," reframing the glitch not as a failure but as a "positive disruptor" that reveals fundamental truths about our media. She defines the glitch as a "moment/um"—a powerful, confusing break in a system's flow that shatters our expectations and forces a critical re-evaluation of the technology we use.   

This embrace of error places glitch art squarely within two broader theoretical frameworks: post-digital aesthetics and media archaeology. The "post-digital condition" describes a state where digital technology is so ubiquitous that it is no longer remarkable. Post-digital aesthetics, in turn, often involves a renewed interest in the material, the imperfect, and the analog. Glitch art epitomizes this sensibility by fetishizing the very errors, artifacts, and material mortality that the early digital revolution sought to eliminate, thereby celebrating the creative potential of destruction and disintegration. This aligns closely with the practice of media archaeology, which examines media history by focusing on obsolete, failed, or forgotten technologies. Glitch aesthetics functions as a form of practical media archaeology; by causing a system to fail, it "defamiliarizes the slick surface" of hardware and software, making the invisible technological substrate visible. As theorists Olga Goriunova and Alexei Shulgin state, a glitch reveals the "ghostly conventionality of the forms by which digital spaces are organized".   

The work of artists like JODI and theorists like Menkman elevates the glitch from a mere aesthetic choice to a critical, even political, act. Technology is never neutral; its design is shaped by corporate interests, ideological assumptions, and social conventions. JODI's work is a direct "battle against the hegemonic flows of proprietary media systems," subverting the "predetermined ways in which users are conditioned by corporations to interact with technology". Menkman argues that by creating these breaks, artists make the audience aware of the "preprogrammed patterns" that govern their digital lives, opening up the possibility for a "new interaction gestalt" to form. Intentionally creating a glitch is therefore an act of reclaiming agency. It is a refusal to use a tool "as intended" and, by extension, a critique of the power structures embedded within that tool. This suggests that an AI degradation layer could function not just as a stylistic filter, but as a critical tool for users to assert creative control and question the opaque, seamless operation of AI systems.   

Part II: A Technical Lexicon of Digital Degradation
2.1 The Grammar of Corruption: Software-Based Data Manipulation

The foundational techniques of glitch art often involve the direct manipulation of a file's underlying data through software. These methods treat digital files not as immutable images or videos, but as malleable blocks of text and code that can be bent, broken, and reinterpreted.

Databending: This is the quintessential software-based glitch technique, defined as the process of manipulating a media file of one format using software designed to edit files of a different format. The resulting distortions are a direct consequence of this format mismatch.   

The "WordPad Effect": A classic and accessible databending method involves opening an image file (such as a.bmp or.tiff) in a simple text editor like WordPad. The program attempts to interpret the raw image data as Rich Text Format (RTF), and upon saving, introduces changes to the file's structure that manifest as visual glitches when the file is reopened in an image viewer.   
Sonification (The Audacity Method): A more versatile technique involves importing an image or video file into an audio editing program like Audacity as "raw data". This translates the rows of pixels into an audio waveform. The artist can then apply a range of audio effects—such as echo, reverb, compression, or inversion—to this waveform. When the file is exported back as raw data and reopened as an image, these audio manipulations produce direct visual analogues. For example, applying an echo filter can create repeating, ghost-like layers in the image, as the effect duplicates sections of the file's data. This method is also categorized as "misalignment," as it involves opening a file in an inappropriate program.   
Hex Editing: For more precise control, artists use a hex editor to directly view and manipulate a file's raw binary data in hexadecimal format. This method allows for granular changes to specific bytes within the file's code. An artist can target particular sections of an image's data—such as the parts that define color palettes or compression tables—to induce a wide and often unpredictable range of glitches, from subtle color shifts to catastrophic structural collapse. This is a more advanced form of data manipulation.   
Pixel Sorting: This is an algorithmic technique rather than a direct data corruption. It involves using a script or program to rearrange the pixels within an image based on a set of rules, such as their hue, saturation, brightness, or location. Typically, the algorithm will select a row or column of pixels and sort them, creating characteristic streaks and flows of color that disrupt the original image while often retaining some semblance of its form. This method produces a clean, structured form of glitch that feels both organic and computational.   

Process Interruption: This category includes methods that interfere with a file's normal rendering or transmission. A common technique is to deliberately use the wrong codec to decompress a video file, forcing the software to misinterpret the compressed data and produce visual artifacts. It can also involve disrupting data streams or interfering with compression algorithms as they are being applied, creating errors in the final output.   
2.2 Anatomy of a Datamosh: Deconstructing Video Compression

Datamoshing is one of the most recognizable and visually dynamic forms of glitch art, creating effects where video images appear to melt, smear, and bleed into one another. The technique is not a surface-level effect but a fundamental manipulation of how video compression works.   

To understand datamoshing, one must first understand the logic of modern inter-frame video compression, which is designed to save space by eliminating redundant data between consecutive frames. Compressed video is typically composed of three frame types:   

I-Frames (Intra-coded frames): These are complete, self-contained images, much like a JPEG file. They serve as keyframes or anchors in the video stream and do not require information from any other frame to be displayed.   
P-Frames (Predicted frames): These frames are not complete images. Instead, they only store the changes that have occurred since the previous I-frame or P-frame. This data primarily consists of motion vectors that describe how blocks of pixels have moved.   
B-Frames (Bi-predictive frames): These are even more compressed, as they can reference data from both previous and future frames to describe changes.   
Datamoshing exploits this dependency. By deliberately removing or corrupting the anchor I-frames, the subsequent P- and B-frames are left without a valid point of reference. The playback software, attempting to render these "orphaned" frames, applies the stored motion data incorrectly, leading to the characteristic datamosh effects. There are two primary techniques:   

I-Frame Removal (The "Transition" or "Smear" Effect): This is the most common form of datamoshing, often used to create surreal transitions between two different video clips. The process involves editing two clips together and then deleting the I-frame that marks the beginning of the second clip. When the video plays, the P-frames from the second clip have no new reference image to draw upon. Instead, they apply their motion vector data to the final frames of the    

first clip. This causes the pixels and movements of the first scene to "smear" or "bleed" over the composition of the second scene, creating a visually chaotic and fluid effect where one reality appears to melt into another.   
P-Frame Duplication (The "Bloom" Effect): This technique creates a different kind of visual artifact. Instead of removing frames, the artist duplicates a P-frame (or a short sequence of P-frames) over and over again. This causes the motion data contained within those frames to be applied repeatedly to the image. The result is a "trancy, spaced-out visual" where pixels appear to stretch, grow, or "bloom" across the screen, creating a painterly, layered texture that seems to accumulate over time.   
These effects are typically achieved manually using video editing software like Avidemux or After Effects, which allow for the precise deletion and duplication of specific frames in a video's data stream.   

2.3 The Ghost in the Machine: Hardware Manipulation

While many glitch techniques are software-based, another branch of the practice involves direct physical intervention with electronic hardware. These methods underscore the material reality of our digital systems, revealing that the "ghost in the machine" can often be summoned with a soldering iron or a well-placed magnet.

Circuit Bending: Coined by artist Reed Ghazala, circuit bending is the creative customization of low-voltage, battery-powered electronic devices—most commonly children's toys, cheap keyboards, and drum machines—to create new and unintended sound and visual generators. The process involves opening the device and systematically creating short circuits between points on the circuit board to see what new behaviors emerge. Emphasizing spontaneity and randomness, this practice can produce a vast range of erratic sounds and, in devices with video output, distorted visuals. It is a direct, hands-on method of subverting a technology's intended function.   
Hardware Failure and Physical Disruption: This category encompasses other methods of inducing glitches through physical means. It is a continuation of the legacy of Nam June Paik's Magnet TV. Examples include:

Intentional Damage: Physically damaging the internal components of a device, such as a VHS player, can cause its playback mechanism to fail in visually interesting ways, producing colorful static and distorted images.   
System Interruption: Forcibly interrupting a machine's operation can cause it to display garbage data. This was the method used in the 1978 video art piece Digital TV Dinner, where artist Jamie Fenton would physically strike a Bally video game system, causing the game cartridge to momentarily pop out. This interrupted the system's ability to read the game data, leading to "strange patterns to be drawn" on the screen as the system tried to process invalid information.   
Glitch Scanning: A more controlled physical technique involves manipulating an image or the scanner itself during the scanning process. For instance, an artist might move a printed photograph around on the scanner bed while the scan is in progress, creating warped, stretched, and layered effects in the final digital image.   
2.4 A Visual Dictionary of Digital Artifacts

To provide a precise and actionable vocabulary for an AI degradation layer, the following table categorizes common digital artifacts, linking their visual appearance to their technical cause and artistic application. This taxonomy translates the historical and technical analysis into a functional lexicon that can inform the development of procedural degradation tools.

Artifact Name	Visual Characteristics	Common Technical Cause(s)	Artistic Application/Effect	Relevant Snippets
Pixelation	Visible, blocky squares of single color, giving a low-resolution or "jagged" appearance.	Displaying a bitmap at too large a size; low image resolution; nearest-neighbor scaling.	Evokes retro-computing and pixel art aesthetics; used for censorship; signifies a loss of detail.	
Macroblocking	Grid-like blocks or tiles (often 8x8 or 16x16 pixels) become visible, especially in flat areas of color. Also called blocking, tiling, checkerboarding.	Heavy lossy compression using block-based algorithms like Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) in JPEG, MPEG, etc.	Exposes the underlying grid of the compression codec; creates a mosaic or quilt-like texture; signifies data loss and digital materiality.	
Color Banding / Posterization	Abrupt, step-like transitions in color gradients instead of smooth blends.	Quantization errors during compression; low color depth (e.g., converting a 24-bit image to 8-bit).	Creates stark, graphic contours; simplifies the color palette; can produce a painterly or stylized effect.	
Ringing / Mosquito Noise	Shimmering, dot-like artifacts or halos that appear around sharp edges.	Quantization of high-frequency information in DCT-based compression. In video, this appears as "mosquito noise" that swarms around objects.	Adds a sense of digital "static" or instability; creates an ethereal or vibrating quality around subjects.	
Data Smearing / Bleeding	Motion vectors from a previous scene are incorrectly applied to a new scene, causing pixels to "smear" or "melt" across the frame.	I-frame removal in datamoshing.	Creates a surreal, fluid, and chaotic transition between scenes; visually represents the blending of different moments in time.	
Bloom Effect	Pixels from a static or slow-moving frame are replicated and appear to grow or "bloom" across the screen over time.	P-frame duplication in datamoshing.	Creates a trance-like, layered, and painterly visual texture; gives the impression of a scene dissolving or crystalizing.	
Color Degradation	Intentional reduction, distortion, or alteration of colors; muted hues, oversaturation, or shifts in color balance.	Databending (e.g., sonification); direct manipulation of color channel data; incorrect codec interpretation.	Evokes the look of a malfunctioning display or faded print material; creates a disruptive or dreamlike mood.	
  
Part III: Case Studies in Glitch Art and the Future of Aesthetic Error
3.1 Masters of Malfunction: Key Artists and Seminal Works

By examining the work of key artists, the theoretical and technical aspects of glitch art become concrete. These case studies demonstrate the diverse ways in which the aesthetics of failure have been harnessed for conceptual and expressive purposes.

Cory Arcangel: Hacking Nostalgia
Cory Arcangel's work employs what can be described as a "semi-archeological methodology," excavating and repurposing obsolete digital technologies to comment on their cultural significance and rapid obsolescence. His most iconic piece,    

Super Mario Clouds (2002), involved hacking a 1985 Nintendo Entertainment System game cartridge of Super Mario Bros.. By meticulously altering the game's code, Arcangel erased every element—Mario, the enemies, the platforms, the score, and the sound—leaving only the serene, pixelated clouds scrolling endlessly across a blue sky. The work operates on multiple levels. It is an act of minimalist abstraction, pushing a familiar representational image to its barest essentials. It is also a poignant reflection on nostalgia and memory; for those who grew up with the game, the isolated background evokes a sense of melancholy and loss. By stripping a mass-produced object of its interactive function, Arcangel transforms a piece of pop culture into a contemplative, almost painterly, moving image, highlighting the tension between high art and DIY internet culture.   
Phillip Stearns: From Digital to Tactile
Phillip Stearns' work directly confronts the supposed immateriality of the digital by translating its processes into tangible, physical objects. His ongoing project, Glitch Textiles (2011-present), renders the abstract language of digital failure into intimate, tactile materials like woven blankets, scarves, and tapestries. The patterns for these textiles are generated from actual digital glitches, often created by physically short-circuiting the electronics of digital cameras or by using data visualization techniques on raw binary data. The resulting images—full of vibrant, chaotic, and complex patterns—are then woven on computerized Jacquard looms. This process creates a fascinating loop: a physical intervention (circuit bending) creates a digital error, which is then translated back into a physical object (a textile) using a digital manufacturing process. Stearns' work powerfully argues for the "vital materiality" of the digital world, demonstrating that the code, signals, and errors that structure our reality have a physical presence that can "touch and move us".   
JODI: Subverting the Interface
The art collective JODI has been a relentless force in net.art and glitch art since the mid-1990s, engaging in a radical deconstruction of the digital interfaces that mediate our lives. Their work is a form of "technological intervention" that aims to disrupt the seamless, user-friendly facades of software, websites, and video games. They have modified classic games like    

Wolfenstein 3D and Quake, disassembling them into their basic parts and reassembling them in nonsensical ways that reveal the underlying logic of the game engine through its failures. Their video installation    

My%Desktop (2002) presents a chaotic performance of a computer desktop gone haywire, with cascading error messages and endlessly replicating files, forcing a "Heideggerian mindfulness" about the role technology plays in our perception of the world. JODI's confrontational approach is a direct critique of the internet's evolution from what was once perceived as a "people's medium" into a highly controlled "corporate medium". By breaking the interface, they expose the hidden conventions and power structures that govern our digital interactions.   

3.2 The Poetics of Error: Applying the Glitch Vocabulary to AI Systems

The principles of glitch art provide a powerful framework for understanding and creatively engaging with the next frontier of digital technology: artificial intelligence. As AI systems become more sophisticated, their failures and errors offer a new canvas for aesthetic exploration.

Common failures in AI image generation—such as producing a human hand with six fingers, creating nonsensical object fusions, or misinterpreting a prompt in a bizarre way—can be reframed as a form of unintentional or "wild" glitch art. These errors are not merely technical mistakes; they are revelatory moments that expose the AI's underlying "interpretive process". They make visible the limitations of the training data, the biases embedded within the algorithm, and the gaps in the machine's "understanding" of the world. This can lead to a form of "algorithmic surrealism," where the AI's cold, relentless logic, when applied to incomplete or ambiguous data, produces outputs that appear dreamlike, irrational, and strangely profound to a human observer.   

This opens the door for the intentional degradation of AI output as a new artistic practice. The development of an "AI Degradation layer" would move beyond simply adding a "glitchy" filter and instead involve the procedural application of the techniques outlined in this report to AI-generated content. This represents a form of creative misuse, where the goal is not to perfect the AI's output but to deliberately corrupt it to explore new aesthetic territories. A framework for such a layer could include functions designed to:   

Simulate Compression Failures: Procedurally apply controlled macroblocking, color banding, or mosquito noise to AI-generated images, making their digital nature manifest and disrupting their often hyper-realistic finish.

Perform Algorithmic Databending: Develop methods to access and manipulate an AI's latent space representation of an image. This could involve converting that latent data into another format (like an audio waveform), applying distortions, and then decoding it back into an image, creating novel and unpredictable transformations.

Induce "Conceptual Datamoshing": Create a tool that blends the latent space representations of two distinct AI-generated images. By forcing the model to render the transitional states between these two concepts, one could create a visual "smear" analogous to I-frame removal in video datamoshing, but operating on a purely semantic level.

The intentional "glitching" of AI art serves a vital critical purpose in an age of increasingly autonomous and opaque technologies. It directly challenges the perceived authority, objectivity, and neutrality of AI systems. By making the computational process visible, fallible, and open to manipulation, a glitch aesthetic can counter the narrative that AI art leads to a "loss of humanity" by imbuing it with deliberate, human-directed imperfection and authorship. Furthermore, research suggests that the presence of AI art can paradoxically enhance the perceived value and creativity of human-made art. A degradation layer can serve as a tool for artists to assert their creative agency, differentiating their work from standard AI outputs. Ultimately, applying the rich visual and historical vocabulary of glitch art to AI continues the movement's core mission: to challenge our notions of beauty, to question the technologies that shape our world, and to find meaning and creativity in the aesthetics of failure.
