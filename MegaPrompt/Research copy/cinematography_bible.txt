I. CINEMATOGRAPHY BIBLE
SHOT SIZE & FRAMING DOCUMENT
Why you need this: AI doesn't inherently understand the emotional weight of shot sizes

Document should include:

Extreme Wide Shot (EWS): Used for cosmic abandonment, human insignificance
Shots 1, 36, 55a (aerial views)
Human figure should be <5% of frame
Reference: Lawrence of Arabia desert shots
The 50/50 Frame Split:
Character trapped against wall = frame divided exactly in half
Empty space has equal weight to character
Shot 42c, 49a (Sigrid pressed against wall)
The Obscured Frame:
99% frost coverage but 1% clear center
How to maintain narrative through occlusion
Reference: Save the Green Planet's frosted glass shots
Specific Rules:

Close-up = psychological invasion (use sparingly)
Medium shot = normal family interaction
Wide shot = isolation/abandonment
Dutch angle = NEVER (reality is wrong enough)
CAMERA MOVEMENT LANGUAGE
Static vs. Movement Hierarchy:

Absolute Stillness = Divine/monolithic presence (raven appearances)
3Hz Tremor = Magnús contamination (handheld with specific frequency)
Slow Push = Inevitable approach (death, transformation)
360° Rotation = Temporal revelation (all times visible)
Crane Up = Pulling back to cosmic (abandonment)
Document Each Movement's Meaning:

Push in = Forcing confrontation
Pull back = Revealing context/horror
Pan = Time passing/revealing hidden
No movement = Forcing audience to look
II. LIGHTING DESIGN BIBLE
THE THREE LIGHT SOURCES
1. Dying Light (Shots 1-19)

Whale oil lamp = warm 2700K
Flickering at death = irregular strobe
Creates 6 shadows from 5 people
Reference: Barry Lyndon candlelight
2. Industrial Light (Shots 20-60)

Trawler searchlight = harsh 5600K
Mechanical 20-second sweeps
Creates multiple wrong shadows
Reference: Come and See flare sequences
3. Internal Light (Shots 58-63)

Monument self-illumination
Light from within walls
All colors simultaneously (prismatic)
Reference: Enter the Void's astral sequences
Key Ratios Document:

Natural light : Industrial light : Mythological light
100:0:0 (opening)
50:50:0 (middle)
0:50:50 (transformation)
0:0:100 (monument)
SHADOW MAPPING
Every Shot Needs:

Shadow count (usually wrong)
Shadow direction (often impossible)
Shadow form (contradicts body)
Shadow opacity (reveals time layer)
III. PRODUCTION DESIGN BIBLE
SCALE & MEASUREMENT DOCUMENT
Critical Measurements:

House: EXACTLY 12x16 feet (no deviation)
Distance Sigrid maintains: EXACTLY 11 feet
Monument height: EXACTLY 40 feet
Cleft width: EXACTLY 18 inches (infinite inside)
Frost percentage: Maps to exact years
Why This Matters: AI needs specific measurements or it will randomize

V. EDITORIAL RHYTHM BIBLE
THE BREATHING CUT PATTERN
Must Document:

Edit points happen on exhales
12 breaths/minute = 1 cut every 5 seconds maximum
As house dies, cuts slow
Final shots = no cuts, just duration
Mathematical Structure:

Shots 1-10: Average 6 seconds
Shots 11-30: Average 7 seconds
Shots 31-50: Average 8 seconds
Shots 51-55: Average 8 seconds (maximum)
Shot 56b: 30 seconds (NO CUTS)
Shots 57-63: Average 6-8 seconds
THE PATTERN OF MONOLITHIC HOLDS
Three 12-second absolute stillnesses:

Shot 13: First raven appearance
Shot 52: Second raven prophecy
Shot 56b: Extended to 30 seconds (THE shot)
Between these: Increasing instability

VI. SOUND DESIGN MAPPING
FREQUENCY ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENT
Layer Stack:

16Hz - Bergrisi/House consciousness (felt not heard)
40Hz - Magnús fear frequency
60Hz - Trawler drone
528Hz - Transformation frequency
3kHz - Children's fever pitch
8kHz - Raven call
Silence Map (when NO sound):

Shot 35c: After gunshot (4 seconds)
Shot 56b: During 30-second hold (middle 10 seconds)
Shot 57a: Before first breath
After each rope cut (2 seconds)
BREATHING RHYTHMS PER CHARACTER
Must be consistent:

Magnús: 3/min (ram) or 0 (death)
Guðrún: 12/min (administered)
Sigrid: 16/min (human, resisting)
Children: 20/min (lamb rate)
House: 12/min declining to 0
Tilberi: 3 rhythms simultaneously
VII. DEGRADATION SCHEDULE BIBLE
TECHNICAL DECAY TIMELINE
Exact Degradation Per Shot:

python
def get_degradation(shot_number):
    if shot <= 10:
        return "0% - VEO3 pristine"
    elif shot <= 20:
        return "5% - Slight desaturation"
    elif shot <= 30:
        return "15% - Color bleeding"
    elif shot <= 40:
        return "30% - Form dissolution"
    elif shot <= 50:
        return "50% - Identity unstable"
    elif shot <= 55:
        return "75% - Reality breaking"
    elif shot <= 60:
        return "90% - Near abstraction"
    else:
        return "99-100% - Complete dissolution"
PROMPT LANGUAGE DECAY
Document exact progression:

Shots 1-10: Icelandic poetry
"Fjölskylda situr við borð í baðstofu"

Shots 11-30: Danish administration
"Familie nummer 5 i badstue register"

Shots 31-50: Broken English
"Family_count ERROR table sheep maybe"

Shots 51-63: Code/Glitch
"fam.transform(sheep) // NULL REFERENCE"
VIII. ASPECT RATIO & FRAME BIBLE
THE FRAME AS PRISON
Document argues for:

4:3 aspect ratio = trapped, boxed in
OR 2.39:1 = extreme horizontal emptiness
Never 16:9 = too comfortable, too normal
Frame Breaking Moments:

Shot 55c: Image exceeds frame during transformation
Shot 61c: Frame cracks into six segments
Shot 63: Frame dissolves entirely
IX. CONTINUITY ANTI-BIBLE
INTENTIONAL DISCONTINUITIES
Document what should NOT match:

Faces can change between shots
Architecture can shift
Clothing can alter
Time can jump
Weather can reverse
What MUST remain consistent:

The count of 5/6
The 11-foot distance
The house dimensions
The monument appearance
The faldbúningur headdress
X. PERFORMANCE NOTATION BIBLE
THE GESTURAL VOCABULARY
Magnús's Hands:

3Hz tremor = humanity fighting
0Hz = perfect violence/care
Reaching = claiming ownership
Pointing = counting/condemning
Guðrún's Positions:

One step behind = submission
Wool pulling = self-harvesting
Direct gaze = only at death
Sigrid's Distance:

11 feet = maximum safety
Hand on belly = protecting future
Back to wall = nowhere to retreat
XI. LENS CHARACTERISTIC BIBLE
FOCAL LENGTH EMOTIONS
24mm = Cosmic indifference (opening)
35mm = Uncomfortable closeness (house interior)
50mm = "Normal" that feels wrong
85mm = Isolation (Sigrid's perspective)
200mm = Surveillance (trawler watching)
DEPTH OF FIELD RULES
Everything in focus = reality breaking
Shallow DOF = psychological invasion
Split focus = two realities simultaneously
XII. REFERENCE COMPILATION BIBLE
SHOT-BY-SHOT VISUAL REFERENCES
Create a document with:

Each shot number
Primary visual reference (film/painting)
Secondary tonal reference
Degradation reference
Color reference
Example:

Shot 56b (30-second hold):
- Primary: Dreyer's "Passion of Joan of Arc" (Falconetti close-up)
- Tonal: Come and See (Flyora's traumatized stare)
- Degradation: Stan Brakhage's "The Act of Seeing with One's Own Eyes"
- Color: Completely desaturated except tears
XIII. AI-SPECIFIC PROMPT ENGINEERING BIBLE
NEGATIVE PROMPTS (What to exclude):
Never include:
- "Cinematic"
- "Professional"
- "High quality"
- "Beautiful"
- "Symmetric"
- "Perfect"

Always exclude:
- Modern elements
- Clear resolution
- Stable architecture
- Consistent faces
- Normal proportions
POSITIVE PROMPT STRUCTURE:
[Time Period] + [Location] + [Subjects] + [Action] + 
[Lighting] + [Camera] + [Degradation] + [Anomaly]

Example:
"1888 Iceland baðstofa, five family members but six shadows, 
sitting at table counting wrong, whale oil lamp dying, 
static camera 3Hz tremor, 15% color desaturation, 
mathematical impossibility visible"
PRIORITY DOCUMENTS TO CREATE:
Cinematography Bible - Shot sizes, movements, meanings
Lighting Bible - Three light sources and their death
Degradation Schedule - Exact decay per shot
Sound Frequency Map - Who breathes/trembles at what Hz
Color Science Bible - Palette death over time
Scale & Measurement - Exact dimensions (no deviation)
Prompt Engineering Guide - How to speak to AI
These documents aren't just references - they're constitutional law for the film. Every deviation breaks the spell. Every consistency maintains the horror.

The AI needs these as absolute rules, not suggestions. This isn't about making it look good - it's about making it look CORRECTLY WRONG.

Remember: You're not documenting film production - you're documenting reality breaking, consciousness dying, mathematics failing. The documents should read like technical manuals for impossible things.
