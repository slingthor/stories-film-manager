GENIUS CONCEPTS & IDEAS TO RESEARCH FOR AI PROMPTING
The Artistic DNA That Will Elevate Your Film

I. CONCEPTUAL BREAKTHROUGHS TO STUDY
THE KULESHOV EFFECT
What it is: Soviet filmmaker discovered that audiences create meaning between shots, not in them
Why research this: Your transformation happens BETWEEN frames - the audience fills the gap
Prompt application: "Shot A: human at table | Shot B: sheep at table | Audience creates transformation"
Study: The original 1918 experiments - same face + different objects = different emotions
LYNCH'S "ROOM TONE" PHILOSOPHY
From: David Lynch's sound design in Eraserhead
Concept: Every space has its own consciousness expressed through ambient sound
For your film: The house's 16Hz frequency IS Bergrisi speaking
Research: Lynch interviews about "the room is a character"
Prompt enhancement: "The room's acoustic signature at 16Hz"
STAN BRAKHAGE'S "CLOSED-EYE VISION"
Concept: What you see when you press your eyelids = more real than filmed reality
His technique: Painted directly on film, scratched emulsion
For your AI: The glitches and artifacts ARE the dying consciousness's "closed-eye vision"
Prompt idea: "Hypnagogic hallucination," "phosphene patterns," "entoptic phenomena"

II. REVOLUTIONARY IDEAS ABOUT TIME
CHRIS MARKER'S "LA JETÉE" - PHOTOGRAPHY AS MEMORY
Genius concept: Entire film is still photos except ONE moving shot
Why this matters: Memory doesn't move smoothly - it jumps between frozen moments
For your film: The three-frame flash works like this
Research: How stillness can be more dynamic than movement
Prompt application: "Photographic memory fragments," "frozen time except for tears"
TARKOVSKY'S "SCULPTING IN TIME"
His theory: Cinema's unique power is showing time's pressure/weight
The 30-second hold: This IS time pressure - forcing audience to experience duration
Research: His book "Sculpting in Time" - Chapter 3 specifically
Prompt gold: "Time pressure visible," "duration as weight," "temporal density"
HOLLIS FRAMPTON'S "NOSTALGIA" - DELAYED NARRATION
Concept: Image and sound deliberately out of sync - describing previous/next image
Your application: The family is already sheep before we see them transform
Research: Structural film movement - how desynchronization creates meaning
Prompts: "Temporal displacement," "future casting shadow backward"

III. TRANSFORMATION & BODY HORROR PHILOSOPHY
CRONENBERG'S "THE FLY" - DISEASE AS TRANSFORMATION
Not the effects, the IDEA: Transformation is disease you watch yourself undergo
Key insight: Consciousness remains while body changes = ultimate horror
Your family: KNOWS they're becoming sheep
Research term: "Body horror with maintained consciousness"
Prompt: "Aware of own transformation," "watching self change"
KAFKA'S METAMORPHOSIS - NEVER DESCRIBING THE CREATURE
Genius move: Never actually describes what Gregor looks like
Why: Reader's imagination worse than any description
Your film: Never show transformation moment
Research: Kafka's letters about deliberate ambiguity
Prompt technique: "Transformation implied not shown," "horror in absence"
JUNJI ITO'S "UZUMAKI" - PATTERN AS INFECTION
Concept: Spiral pattern literally infects reality
Your film: Five spirals/six points pattern infects everything
Research: How geometric patterns can carry narrative meaning
Prompts: "Spiral infection," "geometric contamination," "pattern as virus"

IV. THE UNCANNY & DOUBLES
JORDAN PEELE'S "US" - THE TETHERED CONCEPT
Idea: Everyone has underground double living parallel life
Your shadows: Sheep shadows for human bodies (and vice versa)
Research: Peele interviews about "we are our own monsters"
Prompt enhancement: "Shadow living different life," "parallel existence visible"
FREUD'S "THE UNCANNY" (DAS UNHEIMLICHE)
Core concept: Most terrifying = familiar made strange
Your film: House is body, family is livestock, food is poison
Must read: The 1919 essay, especially about dolls and doubles
Prompt terms: "Unheimlich," "familiar yet wrong," "domestic made strange"
PESSOA'S HETERONYMS
Concept: Portuguese poet had 75+ different identities who wrote differently
Your application: Family might be one entity experiencing itself as five
Research: "The Book of Disquiet" - fragmented consciousness
Prompts: "Multiple consciousness in one," "fragmented identity"

V. WITNESS & OBSERVATION CONCEPTS
HITCHCOCK'S "REAR WINDOW" - COMPLICIT WATCHING
The genius: Audience becomes guilty by watching
Your camera: Is the seventh family member, is Iceland watching itself
Research: Essays about scopophilia and cinematic gaze
Prompt idea: "Camera as character," "guilty observation," "complicit gaze"
MICHAEL HANEKE'S "CACHÉ" - SURVEILLANCE AS HORROR
Concept: Being watched changes behavior even if watcher unknown
Your family: Knows they're being documented
Research: Haneke on "violence of observation"
Prompts: "Aware of being watched," "performance for invisible audience"
"THE FIVE OBSTRUCTIONS" - DOGME 95
Von Trier's concept: Restrictions create creativity
Your 8-second limit: Is a creative restriction that shapes narrative
Research: The Dogme 95 manifesto - "Vow of Chastity"
Application: List restrictions in prompt: "No shot longer than 8 seconds"

VI. MYTHOLOGICAL TIME & REALITY
ALAN MOORE'S "ETERNALISM" IN WATCHMEN
Concept: All moments exist simultaneously - time is a solid
Your monument: Exists in all times at once
Research: Dr. Manhattan's perception of time
Prompt gold: "All temporal states simultaneous," "time as solid object"
BORGES' "THE ALEPH" - POINT CONTAINING ALL POINTS
Idea: Single point that contains all other points in space
Your cleft: 18 inches outside, infinite inside
Read: The short story "The Aleph"
Prompt: "Space containing all spaces," "infinite interior in finite exterior"
PHILIP K. DICK'S "TIME OUT OF JOINT"
Concept: Reality is performance, everyone knows but you
Your tourists: See family in monument but think it's art
Research: Dick's theory of orthogonal time
Prompts: "Reality as performance," "truth too true to believe"

VII. DEGRADATION AS NARRATIVE
WILLIAM BASINSKI'S "DISINTEGRATION LOOPS"
What happened: Magnetic tape literally fell apart while playing
The genius: Decay became the composition
Your film: AI degradation IS the story
Listen to: All 6 loops - hear entropy as art
Prompt evolution: "Generation degrading," "entropy as narrative"
JEAN COCTEAU'S "ORPHEUS" - DEATH AS BUREAUCRACY
Concept: Death is administrative process with forms and procedures
Your Danish counting: Administration as death sentence
Research: The "Zone" sequences - bureaucratic afterlife
Prompts: "Administrative horror," "bureaucracy as death," "counting as killing"
NAM JUNE PAIK'S "MAGNET TV"
Concept: Magnets on CRT creating planned distortion
Your approach: AI artifacts as intentional aesthetics
Research: Video art using errors as features
Prompts: "Intentional artifacts," "glitch as meaning," "error as message"

VIII. ARCHITECTURAL CONSCIOUSNESS
SHIRLEY JACKSON'S "HILL HOUSE" OPENING
The line: "Whatever walked there, walked alone"
Concept: House has agenda, selects inhabitants
Your house: Bergrisi choosing who survives
Research: Jackson's notes on sentient architecture
Prompts: "Architecture with agency," "building choosing inhabitants"
TSUKAMOTO'S "TETSUO" - FLESH/METAL FUSION
Concept: Industrial materials growing into/from body
Your contamination: Rope through neck, brass eyes
Research: Japanese cyberpunk philosophy
Prompts: "Industrial materials fused with flesh," "mechanical infection"

IX. ESSENTIAL PARADOXES TO UNDERSTAND
SCHRÖDINGER'S CAT
Why research: Your family is simultaneously human AND sheep
Application: Observation doesn't resolve state - maintains paradox
Prompt technique: "Superposition maintained," "both states true"
ZENO'S PARADOX
The concept: Infinite steps to cross finite distance
Your application: Magnús never reaching water, infinite effort
Prompt idea: "Motion impossible yet happening," "infinite regression"
THE SHIP OF THESEUS
Question: If all parts replaced, is it same ship?
Your family: If all become sheep, are they still family?
Prompt philosophy: "Identity persisting through total change"

X. PRACTICAL PROMPT IMPROVEMENTS FROM THESE CONCEPTS
INSTEAD OF: "Family at table"
USE: "Family at table like Hammershøi painting - negative space has weight"
INSTEAD OF: "Sheep transformation"
USE: "Metamorphosis implied through shadow like German Expressionism"
INSTEAD OF: "House breathing"
USE: "Architecture breathing like Cronenberg's living buildings, 12 respirations per minute"
INSTEAD OF: "Raven watching"
USE: "Raven holding Marker's La Jetée stillness - time stopped except consciousness"
INSTEAD OF: "Industrial contamination"
USE: "Tetsuo-style industrial infection, materials growing through flesh"
INSTEAD OF: "Time breaking"
USE: "Temporal superposition like Dr. Manhattan's perception - all moments simultaneous"

These concepts aren't just references - they're WAYS OF THINKING that will make your prompts create something beyond technical competence. You're not making pretty pictures - you're generating traumatized consciousness, sick time, living architecture, impossible mathematics.
The AI needs to understand it's not depicting - it's BEING the dying memory, the broken mathematics, the impossible truth.
