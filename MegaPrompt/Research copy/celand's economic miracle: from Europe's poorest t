Poverty and colonial subjugation defined early Iceland
Iceland entered the 20th century as one of Western Europe's poorest nations, WikipediaWikipedia with a GDP per capita in 1901 roughly equivalent to Ghana's in 2006 - approximately $2,640 in purchasing power parity terms. WikipediaCEPR The country's 78,000 inhabitants StatistaEncyclopedia Britannica faced harsh living conditions that would be unrecognizable today. Infant mortality reached 250-300 deaths per 1,000 live births in the mid-19th century, nearly double Denmark's rate, ResearchGate while life expectancy lagged significantly behind European averages.
The Danish trade monopoly from 1602 to 1855 systematically impoverished Iceland through price manipulation. Wikipedia Danish merchants kept fish prices artificially low while inflating agricultural product costs, preventing capital accumulation and industrial development. Wikipedia Even after trade liberalization in 1855, Iceland remained overwhelmingly rural with minimal infrastructure - the first motorized fishing vessel only arrived in 1905, Wikipedia +2 and the country lacked basic roads, harbors, and modern buildings.
