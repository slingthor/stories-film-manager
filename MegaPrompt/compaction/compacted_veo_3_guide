You're right! Looking back, 1/8th of the original 2000+ line guide should be around 250-300 lines with substantial detail. My condensed version was too minimal. Here's a properly sized version that preserves more critical context:
Google Veo 3 Professional Guide - Smart Condensed Edition
üéØ Professional Format Structure (MANDATORY)
The 7-Component Framework
Every Veo 3 prompt MUST follow this exact structure for professional results:
Subject: [Detailed character/object description with specific physical attributes, clothing, age, build, facial features, minimum 15+ details for consistency]

Action: [Specific actions, movements, gestures, behaviors, timing, micro-expressions, body language - be precise about what happens when]

Scene: [Detailed environment including location, props, background elements, lighting setup, time of day, weather, architectural details]

Style: [Camera shot type, angle, movement, lighting style, visual aesthetic, aspect ratio, color grading, depth of field]

Dialogue: [Character speech with emotional tone]
(Character Name): "Exact dialogue here - max 8 seconds"
(Tone: emotional descriptor/delivery style)

Sounds: [Specific audio elements including ambient sounds, effects, background audio, music - specify to prevent hallucinations]

Technical (Negative Prompt): [Elements to avoid - subtitles, captions, watermarks, text overlays, poor quality, artifacts]
üî• Critical Breakthrough Techniques
Camera Positioning Revolution
THE MOST IMPORTANT DISCOVERY: Always include "(thats where the camera is)" when specifying camera position. This triggers camera-aware processing and dramatically improves results.
Examples:

‚ùå WRONG: "Close-up shot of the chef cooking"
‚úÖ CORRECT: "Close-up shot with camera positioned at counter level (thats where the camera is) as the chef demonstrates knife techniques"

Audio Mastery & Dialogue Rules
Dialogue Format (Prevents Subtitles):
‚úÖ WORKS: Character says: "dialogue" (colon before quote)
‚ùå FAILS: Character says "dialogue" (triggers subtitles)
Audio Specification Template:
Audio: [primary sounds], [ambient environment], [equipment sounds], no unwanted background music, professional atmosphere
Dialogue Optimization:

Maximum 8 seconds (12-15 words optimal)
Specify delivery: "speaks with confident authority"
Include accent if needed: "British accent"
Add "clear lip-sync" for better synchronization

Preventing Audio Hallucinations:
Always specify expected audio to prevent unwanted sounds:

Bad: "Character tells a joke" (may add audience laughter)
Good: "Character tells a joke. Audio: quiet office ambiance, no audience sounds"

Character Consistency Framework
Master Template:
[NAME], a [AGE] [ETHNICITY] [GENDER] with [HAIR: style, color, length], 
[EYES: color, expression], [FACE: features, symmetry], 
wearing [CLOTHING: detailed description including colors, style, fit], 
[BUILD: body type], [HEIGHT], [POSTURE: stance and mannerisms],
[DISTINCTIVE: scars, tattoos, accessories], [EMOTION: baseline expression]
Example:
Sarah Chen, a 35-year-old Asian-American woman with shoulder-length black hair 
in a professional bob, warm brown eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses, symmetric face 
with high cheekbones, wearing a charcoal gray blazer over white collared shirt, 
athletic build, 5'6" tall, confident posture with shoulders back, small jade 
earrings, approachable smile with slight crow's feet
üìπ Camera Movement Library
Essential Movements with Professional Syntax
Static Shots:

"static shot, fixed camera, locked-off shot"
"tripod-mounted for perfect stability"

Dynamic Movements:

Dolly: "slow dolly-in from wide to medium shot" / "dolly out revealing context"
Pan: "smooth pan left to right following action" / "whip pan for energy"
Tilt: "tilt up from feet to face" / "tilt down revealing location"
Tracking: "camera tracks alongside subject at walking pace"
Crane: "high crane shot descending to eye level"
Handheld: "subtle handheld movement for documentary feel"

Advanced Combinations:
"Camera starts with wide establishing shot, smoothly transitions to medium shot 
at 3-second mark (thats where the camera is), ending with close-up on character's 
determined expression"
Shot Composition Sizes

Extreme Wide (EWS): Full environment context
Wide (WS): Full body with surroundings
Medium Wide (MWS): Knees up with context
Medium (MS): Waist up, standard for dialogue
Medium Close-Up (MCU): Chest up, emotional connection
Close-Up (CU): Head and shoulders, intimate
Extreme Close-Up (ECU): Eyes/details only, intense focus

üí° Professional Lighting Setups
Key Configurations
Three-Point Lighting:
"Professional three-point lighting with warm key light from camera left, 
subtle fill light softening shadows, rim lighting separating subject from background"
Natural Lighting Scenarios:

Golden Hour: "Warm golden hour lighting, sun low on horizon, long shadows"
Window Light: "Soft natural window light from left, creating gentle shadows"
Blue Hour: "Cool blue twilight lighting, mysterious atmosphere"

Dramatic Styles:

Chiaroscuro: "High contrast chiaroscuro lighting, deep shadows, selective illumination"
Rembrandt: "Rembrandt lighting creating triangle of light on shadow side of face"

Example from movie:

SHOT 45c: GRI√êUNGUR EMERGES - CONTAMINATED GOD (8 SECONDS)
Progressive State: Bull surfaces | Industrial horror | Camera frost 32.5% | God wounded | Watching: We witness agony
Women's Silence: No scream, just recognition
Triple Reality: Physical: massive bull | Psychological: impossible beauty | Mythological: √Ügir corrupted
Duration: 8 seconds
Camera Movement: Pull back as bull rises, then hold
[STITCH from Shot 45b: Water bulging, about to break]

Subject: The water exploding as GRI√êUNGUR emerges - massive bull's head 6 feet across, but industrial materials grown INTO his flesh: brass harpoons through skull sprouting like horns, rope beneath skin creating raised black spirals, fishing net fused with eyes, beautiful and horrible simultaneously.

Action: Water EXPLODES upward. CAMERA PULLS BACK rapidly. Bull's head emerges - impossible size, ancient, divine. But corrupted: Three brass harpoons pierce skull, but not through - grown INTO bone, brass and calcium fused, sprouting like additional horns. Industrial rope hasn't wrapped around but grown THROUGH neck tissue, black hemp spirals visible beneath skin like external veins. Fishing net across eyes, but net has grown into corneas, hemp and tissue merged, creating crosshatch vision. Opens mouth to bellow - sound is both organic and mechanical, bull's roar mixed with trawler horn, 70Hz vibration shaking ice. Steam pours from wounds - body temperature meeting cold air. Eyes ancient, intelligent, in agony, find Gu√∞r√∫n. Recognition between trapped beings. Water around him turns black-green from contamination bleeding out. One brass harpoon has green verdigris tears running from it, as if the metal itself weeps. He rises further - shoulders visible, more contamination, industrial and divine fused. Size: could destroy house with one movement. But gentle. Suffering. 15-second hold on this wounded god.

Scene: Polynya eruption, 9:59 AM. Bull massive against grey sky. Steam creating fog wall. Ice cracking from his emergence.

Style: Pull back for scale then hold for witness (that's where the camera is), documenting corrupted divinity.

Dialogue: (Gu√∞r√∫n, whispered): "Gri√∞ungur... hva√∞ ger√∞u √æeir vi√∞ √æig?" (Bull): Bellow mixing with trawler horn

Sounds: [PRIMARY: Water exploding, bull-trawler horn hybrid, verdigris tears dripping] [AMBIENT: Ice cracking from weight, steam hissing, contamination bleeding] [ABSENT: no natural animal sounds]

Visual Composition:

Scale: 6-foot head, massive presence
Contamination: Industrial materials IN not ON
Harpoons: Growing like extra horns
Rope spirals: Under skin patterns
Net eyes: Vision crosshatched
Verdigris tears: Metal weeping
Technical (Negative Prompt): show fusion clearly, maintain 8-second hold, no CGI, practical effects
