THE SHEEP IN THE BAÐSTOFA: PRODUCTION BIBLE (1/10TH CONDENSATION)
CORE CONCEPT & PHILOSOPHY
12-minute Icelandic horror film set February 13-14, 1888, Westfjords, documenting a family's transformation into sheep through hamskiptingur (shape-shifting). Not metaphorical - literal documentation of people discovering they're wearing wrong physical forms while their human shapes hang empty elsewhere, still breathing.

Three-Layer Reality Structure (never confirm which is "true"):

Physical: Starvation, isolation madness, ergot poisoning, hereditary illness
Psychological: Shared delusion, dissociation, trauma response to colonial violence
Supernatural: Ancient curse, punishment for abandoning traditions, evolution beyond human
Technical Constraints: 85 shots @ 8 seconds each (Veo 3 limit), 12×16ft turf house with 6ft ceiling, 3-tier sleeping platforms (1ft/3ft/5ft), five family members but six shadows.

CINEMATOGRAPHIC REVOLUTION
The Tarr-Tarkovsky-Lubezki Synthesis
MANDATORY: Replace Shots 0-7 with ONE 4-minute unbroken take: Begin 5000ft above barren tundra, camera descends through aurora that "dies" (scientific term), through smoke hole into baðstofa, past sleeping family breathing at different rates, into extreme close-up of breath crystallizing at wrong temperature, pull back revealing Magnús counting family, his finger hesitating at empty sixth space, continue through house discovering each member's position, finally rest on hanging hákarl dripping at 1 drop/3 seconds. Duration forces viewers to EXIST with impossibility. Sound: breathing rates gradually synchronizing from chaos (12/14/16/18/22 per minute) to unity (8/min).

Revolutionary Lens Discipline (Three Visual Languages)
Never mix these within single shot - maintain strict grammar:

Physical Reality Layer:

Handheld camera, 12mm wide-angle Lubezki-style
Natural light only, 24fps standard
Documentary immediacy, "accidental" framing
Prompt: "documentary handheld, natural lighting, breath visible at -10°C"
Psychological Reality Layer:

Locked tripod, no movement, clinical observation
Tilt-shift creating selective reality blur
20fps slight slow-motion, desaturated 30%
Prompt: "impossible focal planes, some sharp others soft, lens whacking creating organic light leaks"
Supernatural Reality Layer:

Probe lens from impossible positions (inside mouths, through walls)
Orthochromatic filtration eliminating red spectrum >570nm
Split diopter creating dual realities in frame
18fps temporal distortion
Prompt: "probe lens perspective from impossible positions (that's where the camera is)"
The Mathematics as Narrative Spine
Counting degradation tracks transformation:

Shot 8: "Einn...tveir...þrír...fjórir...fimm" (normal, loving)
Shot 27b: "Einn...tveir...þrír...fjórir...fimm...ekkert" (nothing - first break)
Shot 43: "Einn...tveir...þrír...fjórir...fimm..." [3-frame sheep flash here]
Shot 58: "Einn...tveir...þrír...fjórir...fimm...sex" (impossible six)
Shot 68: "Fimm...sex...ellefu...þrjú" (5...6...11...3 - complete mathematical glossolalia)
Shot 84: "Ellefu...en sex...hvort eru sex" (eleven...but six...both are six)
VEO 3 PROMPTING ARCHITECTURE
Core Prompt Structure (EVERY SHOT)
Subject: [Character with accumulating details across shots - "Magnús from previous scenes, ice crystals now in beard, same weathered rectangular face showing mathematical certainty breaking"]
Action: [8-second progression with precise timing: "0-2 seconds normal, 2-4 seconds tremor begins at 2Hz, 4-6 seconds tremor increases to 4Hz, 6-8 seconds complete stillness"]
Scene: [Exact measurements: "Interior baðstofa 12×16ft, 6ft ceiling, turf walls with exposed straw yellowing from smoke, -10°C interior, breath visible, whale oil lamp creating 3ft amber cone with sharp falloff to darkness"]
Style: [Camera position + lens: "Camera 6 inches from puddle surface (that's where the camera is), 40mm lens matching Son of Saul intimacy, locked position no movement"]
Dialogue: [With breakdown: "Speaking Old Norse 'Hvað er það?' normal, shifting to Danish 'Hvad er det?' causing frost on windows"]
Audio: [Layered frequencies: "Father breathing 12/min heavy labored, house settling 200Hz, trawler horn 70-85Hz constant beneath, no music"]
Technical (Negative Prompt): [Constraints: "no CGI, no camera movement, no subtitles, no modern elements, practical effects only"]
The Three-Layer Prompt Philosophy
Every prompt must contain Physical+Psychological+Supernatural simultaneously:

Wide shot of Sigrid pulling white wool through wooden carders 
[PHYSICAL: traditional textile work], her movements becoming 
increasingly mechanical and repetitive entering trance state 
[PSYCHOLOGICAL: dissociation from trauma], while wool strands 
pull back against her hands with subtle resistance as if alive 
[SUPERNATURAL: animate materials], camera slowly pushing in over 
8 seconds, whale oil lamp flame flickers when wool resists but 
no draft present [REALITY BREAK: impossible physics], her lips 
moving silently counting strokes in Old Norse "einn...tveir...þrír..." 
but count never exceeds three before restarting [MATHEMATICAL CONTAMINATION]
Historical Authenticity as Horror Multiplier
Never generic - always specific:

NOT: "old Icelandic house"
BUT: "1888 baðstofa, turf walls with visible straw insulation 
yellowing from decades of whale oil smoke, walls breathing slightly 
from -40°C exterior/-10°C interior pressure differential creating 
2cm oscillation, packed earth floor worn smooth in traffic patterns 
but frost crystals forming in corners, sleeping platforms constructed 
from driftwood salvaged from British merchant wreck 1847, iron pot 
suspended from chain showing 41 years of soot accumulation"
CRITICAL SHOT BREAKDOWNS
Shot 37b: The Ram Emergence (Revolutionary 15-second hold)
Complete Veo 3 Prompt:

Subject: Massive Icelandic ram with seaweed-tangled wool, coal-black industrial rope wound through fleece appearing to grow from skin not tangled externally, fragments of British merchant marine uniform (brass buttons, wool fragments) fused into living tissue
Action: Rising from black polynya over 8 seconds maintaining impossible stillness except water streaming off in real-time physics, steam creating exactly 6-inch thermal boundary where -25°C air meets body heat, snowflakes vaporizing on contact
Scene: Arctic shoreline at magnetic midnight (3am but sun visible), minus 25°C, 40mph katabatic winds, single whale oil lamp on pole creating 3-foot visibility sphere, distant trawler smoke on horizon
Style: Camera positioned exactly 6 inches above waterline using probe lens perspective (that's where the camera is), 15-second completely locked hold no movement whatsoever, orthochromatic filtration eliminating red spectrum making ram appear carved from stone
Dialogue: None
Audio: Under-ice swell at 30Hz creating subsonic dread, wind dropping to complete silence at moment of full emergence (4-6 seconds), Guðrún's breathing stops completely for 4 seconds then resumes at sheep-rate 20/min not human 12/min, trawler horn at exactly 75Hz continuing indifferent, no music
Technical (Negative Prompt): no camera movement even slight, no cutting away, no normal physics except this one anomaly, no CGI, practical effects only
Shot 51: The Headdress Revelation
Ari Aster dollhouse perspective meeting Lynch's radiator lady:

Subject: Sheep's head wearing pristine white Icelandic faldbúningur headdress with black velvet band and brass pin at temple, one human grey hair caught in wool near pin, positioned exactly as grandmother would wear it, eyes closed in unnatural human sleep pattern not sheep rest
Action: Absolute zero movement for first 6 seconds creating increasing discomfort, at 6 seconds breathing shifts from sheep's 20/minute to human 12/minute with audible cartilage crackling during transition, at 7.5 seconds single tear emerges from closed eye
Scene: Interior baðstofa corner, morning light through smoke hole creating Rembrandt lighting, background falls to pure black void
Style: Overhead shot from impossible ceiling position where roof was removed (that's where the camera is), 1.19:1 aspect ratio creating vertical compression, perfect center composition, camera locked at 8 feet distance
Audio: Only breathing - first at sheep rate 20/min, shifting to human rate 12/min at 6 seconds with subtle wet cartilage crackling at transition moment, house holding its breath
Technical: Orthochromatic film stock eliminating red light beyond 570nm, 800W halogen practical light at 45° above, no background, no blinking
Shot 57: Child's Voice Without Cutting to Black
Revolutionary snorkel lens solution:

Subject: Close-up of sheep's mouth and throat, visible tension in neck muscles, tongue movement not matching sound produced
Action: Sheep opens mouth at 2 seconds, child's voice emerges at 4 seconds speaking Icelandic "Mamma? Mamma, ég er..." voice breaks into bleat mid-word on "svangur" with "svan-" human and "-gur" becoming sheep bleat
Style: Revolution Snorkel Lens performing 360° rotation over 8 seconds creating reality spiral as voice emerges, simultaneous rack focus from eyes to mouth, tilt-shift lens creating selective reality blur making everything except mouth lose coherence
Audio: Sheep breathing 0-4 seconds at 20/min, child's voice emerging 4-8 seconds with 3-5% time-stretch on "Mamma" creating uncanny wrongness, word "svangur" (hungry) degrading from human to animal mid-syllable
Technical: Probe lens rotating creating spiral distortion, forced to witness impossible moment, no cutting away, practical voice processing
Shot 50: The Family Transformed (Breaking Cinema)
Subject: Five Icelandic sheep occupying exact human sleeping positions established in previous scenes, wearing fragments of family's clothing - Magnús's brown vadmál sweater inside-out on ram revealing Guðrún's repaired stitching from Act 1
Action: 8 seconds no movement except synchronized breathing at exactly 8 breaths per minute visible as vapor in -8°C air, at 6 seconds ram attempts to fix sweater with hooves giving up after 2 seconds
Scene: Interior baðstofa at dawn, golden light through smoke hole revealing without explaining, scattered wool tufts on floor suggesting violence
Style: Camera positioned perpendicular to sleeping platforms shooting from north wall looking south (that's where the camera is), flattening depth so all five sheep appear on same plane despite different platform heights, creating specimen display effect
Audio: Five synchronized breathing at unnatural 8/min creating eerie unity, no sheep sounds no bleating, house settling at 200Hz, distant trawler horn at 70Hz indifferent, crucially: 6th breath audible with no visible source - coming from empty human-hamr elsewhere
Technical: Wide locked shot, documentary objectivity despite witnessing impossibility, camera maintains stillness suggesting shock
NEW Shot 58a: Inside the Empty Human-Hamr (Most Terrifying)
Subject: Complete darkness but we're viewing from inside empty human skins hanging like discarded clothing, skin translucent enough to see vague shapes through
Action: Five human-shaped voids inflating/deflating at exactly 8 breaths per minute, no bodies inside them, occasional glimpse of sheep shapes moving beyond
Scene: What seems like inside of closet but is actually inside abandoned human forms
Style: Probe lens threaded through neck hole of empty skin looking outward (that's where the camera is), focus shifting between skin interior and shapes beyond
Audio: Wet organic sound of empty skin breathing, creating impossible acoustic signature of breath without lungs, muffled sheep sounds from outside the skins
Technical: Most disturbing shot in film, pure documentary horror, no explanation provided
Shot 68: The Mathematics Break (Complete Reality Failure)
Subject: Magnús's finger with dirt under nail, trembling at 4Hz, pointing at wall notches
Action: Finger traces five notches carved in wood, hesitates at empty space where sixth should be, shadow of finger creates sixth notch that shouldn't exist given light angle, hand begins pointing to things that aren't there
Scene: Morning light at specific 22.5° angle through window creating impossible shadow-notch
Style: Extreme close-up, rack focus between real notches and shadow-notch, camera 6 inches from wall (that's where the camera is)
Dialogue: "Einn...tveir..." [normal speed] "þrír...fjórir..." [slowing] "fimm..." [confused] [10 second silence while finger hovers] "...sex" [whispered in terror] "nei, það eru ellefu" [no, there are eleven]
Audio: Heartbeat accelerating from 60 to 120bpm, house creaking shifts from 200Hz to 250Hz on "sex", mathematical drone underneath failing to maintain rhythm
Technical: Lens whacking on "sex" creating reality break, practical shadow not CGI
SOUND DESIGN ARCHITECTURE
Breathing as Transformation Vector (CRITICAL)
Track every character's breathing throughout:

Magnús: 12/min heavy labored → 10/min by middle → 8/min transformed
Guðrún: 16/min anxious → syncs with Magnús → 8/min transformed
Sigrid: 14/min controlled → last to sync → maintains human rate longest
Jón: 18/min with wheeze → wheeze disappears when transforms
Lilja: 22/min child-quick → 20/min sheep-rate → 8/min final
The Industrial Contamination Soundscape
Trawler horn forms words through resonance (never confirmed):

Shot 5: 70Hz creates formants matching "COME"
Shot 27: 75Hz creates formants matching "TIME"
Shot 55: 85Hz creates formants matching "DONE"
Shot 85: All frequencies combine into wordless roar
The 666Hz convergence (must be exact): When trawler horn (70-85Hz) + house creaking (200-300Hz) + breathing rhythm (0.13Hz) + wind harmonics combine at revelation moment = exactly 666Hz

Mathematical Polyrhythm Degradation
Subliminal counting drone at 40Hz throughout:

Minutes 0-4: Regular 5-beat pattern (1,2,3,4,5)
Minutes 4-8: Shifting to 6-beat pattern (1,2,3,4,5,6)
Minutes 8-12: Complete arrhythmic chaos
STAGING IN 12×16FT CONSTRAINT
Lumet's Progressive Camera Lowering (12 Angry Men)
Track camera height throughout film:

Shots 1-30: Above eye level (6.5ft) with wide lenses (25mm) = authority
Shots 31-60: Eye level (5.5ft) with normal lenses (50mm) = equality
Shots 61-85: Below eye level (4ft) with telephoto (85mm) = oppression Ceiling enters frame progressively, creating literal lowering ceiling effect.
Bong Joon-ho's Vertical Class Dynamics (Parasite)
Platform heights = social hierarchy:

5ft platform: Authority/safety (but also exposure)
3ft platform: Negotiation space (between human and animal)
1ft platform: Submission/protection (closest to earth/sheep level)
Floor level: Complete degradation
When Sigrid protects children, she pulls them DOWN to 1ft platform - safety through submission. When sheep retreat from Magnús, they go UP platforms - elevation as escape.

Bodies Creating Architecture (Bresson/Von Trier)
Shot 16: Guðrún's body becomes table hiding ritual materials - back as tabletop, Sigrid as table legs Shot 55: Five sheep turn synchronized forming cross when viewed from above - accidental sacred geometry Shot 31: Magnús's hand stops at invisible wall between sleeping areas until breakthrough moment Shot 50: Family positions create pentagon, but shadows form hexagon

The Ozu Tatami Geometry
Every character has designated position creating visual mathematics:

Pentagon formation when human (5 points)
Hexagon formation when transformed (6 points)
Magnús always 3 feet from others (isolation radius)
Children unconsciously arrange in réttir (sheep pen) formation when playing
DIALOGUE MINIMALISM & POETRY
Essential Dialogue Only (Most Should Die)
KEEP (with modifications):

Shot 8: "Einn...tveir...þrír...fjórir...fimm" (establishing counting)
Shot 28: Single word accusation: "Þú..." (You...) [trail off]
Shot 56: "Við vorum alltaf kindur" (We were always sheep) [destroys everything]
Shot 57: "Mamma? Ég er..." [breaks into bleat]
Shot 68: The counting breakdown into glossolalia
Shot 84: "Hvort eru sex" (both are six)
CUT ENTIRELY:

All "best ram" references
Any exposition about hunger
Verbal acknowledgment of transformation
Any dialogue after Shot 57 except counting
Language as Colonial Violence
When Magnús speaks Danish (colonizer's language), frost appears on windows. When he counts in Icelandic, the house breathes easier. The trawler crew speaks Yorkshire English from Icelandic faces - language theft as identity theft.

Practical Effects Mantra (Every Transformation Prompt)
"Practical effects like Rick Baker 1981 American Werewolf, Tom Savini 
latex work, Dick Smith aging effects, liquid latex and actual sheep 
wool glued to skin, foam prosthetics, reverse filmed hair growth, 
grimy 1980s Cronenberg body horror, no CGI, no digital manipulation, 
achieved in-camera"
Budget Maximization Strategy
Film in actual 1888 turf house museum (Glaumbær or similar)
Natural lighting primarily (golden hour lasts 7 hours in summer)
Progressive prosthetics building on each other
One spectacular practical effect for climax vs. many mediocre
Record all sound on location for authentic acoustics
THE HAMSKIPTINGUR REVELATION
Core Truth: This isn't transformation - it's documentation of shape-stealing. The family has always been in wrong hamr (shapes). The sheep ARE the family, their human-hamr hang empty elsewhere, still breathing. Colonial extraction includes stealing physical forms - trawler crew wears Icelandic faces while Icelanders wear animal shapes.

Why Mathematics Break: In hamskiptingur logic, you exist in multiple places simultaneously:

5 in sheep-hamr (visible)
5 empty human-hamr (elsewhere, breathing)
1 observer (Magnús)
= 11 that collapses to 6 (the space between shapes)
The Sixth Being: Not a person but the transformation itself - the moment of exchange between shapes. That's why there are six shadows, six place settings, six of everything, but only five family members visible.

PRODUCTION TIMELINE ARCHITECTURE
The 85-Shot Economy
Shots 1-10: Establishing false golden nostalgia (plant every motif) Shots 11-25: Creeping wrongness (breathing synchronization, counting errors) Shots 26-35: The irreversible event (child discovered in pen, 3-frame flash) Shots 36-55: Paranoid fragmentation (who's human? blood test scene) Shots 56-75: Transformation mechanics (body horror, empty hamr reveal) Shots 76-85: Aftermath ambiguity (cosmic indifference, mathematical death)

VEO 3 PROMPT PHILOSOPHY
The Ten Commandments
Never prompt the scare - prompt normalcy with ONE thing wrong
Include actual Icelandic (West Fjords 1888 dialect)
Every prompt must reference breathing rate
Describe materials with medical specificity: "keratinization," "follicle eruption," "digital fusion"
Layer mundane+psychological+supernatural in EVERY prompt
Include "practical effects only, no CGI" in transformation shots
Reference specific films: "lit like Vermeer," "staged like Ozu," "practical like Rick Baker"
Precise measurements: "3-foot light cone," "breathing at 8/min," "-23°C"
Camera position always: "(that's where the camera is)"
End with absence: "no music," "no explanation," "no acknowledgment of anomaly"
Prompt Evolution Example
First appearance: "Magnús, 55-year-old Icelandic fisherman, weathered rectangular face" Middle: "Magnús from previous scenes, ice crystals in beard, same weathered face but mathematical certainty breaking" Final: "Magnús from all previous scenes, counting on fingers that won't stop at five, consciousness fragmenting between human memory and sheep instinct"

THE ENDING SPECIFICATIONS
Shot 85 (The Cosmic Abandonment):

Exactly 11 seconds duration (5+6)
Camera rises to 5000ft reversing opening
Image increasingly distorts: chromatic aberration, lens warping, frame rate inconsistency
At 6 seconds, extremely faint at -50dB: sound of human shapes walking in sheep bodies while sheep shapes lie in human beds
Audio continues 5 seconds after black: breathing at impossible 11/min
House shadow shows six protrusions that shouldn't exist at this sun angle
FINAL REVELATION
The horror isn't transformation. It's recognition. The family hasn't changed - they're remembering what they always were. The camera documents this remembering, maintaining clinical distance even as reality breaks. The trawler horn continues at 70Hz because industrial modernity doesn't care whose shape you're wearing. Mathematics dies because five has always been six, but we could only count to five before.

The film ends with arithmetic apocalypse - reality can no longer count itself. The breathing continues in darkness because shapes are just clothing, and something keeps breathing after we remove them.

This isn't metaphor. In your film's reality, this is literally happening. Document it with the passive horror of a nature photographer recording extinction.
