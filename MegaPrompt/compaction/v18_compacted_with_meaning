SHOT 44-46c: GUÐRÚN'S JOURNEY AND THE WOUNDED GOD


What Happens: Guðrún enters the storm and feels a moment of freedom, taking her first unobserved breath in years. She follows the blood spirals and completes the impossible sixth line with a trail of wool from her own wrists. At the polynya, the Bull, Griðungur, emerges, horrifically wounded with fused industrial materials. They recognize each other as marked property (both have V-notch scars). She offers her wool to comfort his wounds, and he crawls onto the shore to die, facing the house so his death can be witnessed.






The Deeper Meaning: Her journey completes the cosmic réttir across the landscape; her sacrifice makes the sorting of Iceland possible. The encounter with Griðungur is a meeting of two beings transformed into commodities. Her wool (the product of her body) is used to absorb his industrial poison, a futile but compassionate gesture. His decision to die on the shore facing the house is a deliberate act of witness for the other trapped beings.




SHOT 47-50d: RETURN AND THE TENDER THREAT


What Happens: The trawler's horn pronounces the word "DAUÐUR" (Dead) over the fjord. Guðrún, possibly swimming through a bog of melted blood, returns to the house, which opens its door for her, choosing to protect her. Magnús, his authority challenged by her survival, redirects his attention to Sigrid. In a deeply unsettling sequence, he shows a terrifying tenderness, telling her old stories while touching her, singing the "Krummi" lullaby as a song of possession, and making the incestuous threat explicit: "If something happens to your mother... you become the woman".






The Deeper Meaning: The trawler's pronouncement is the voice of empire declaring death upon the old world. The house protecting Guðrún shows that Bergrisi has chosen a side. Magnús's "tender" approach to Sigrid is the film's most visceral horror. It shows how isolation erodes all moral boundaries, and how patriarchal care can be a form of possession and threat. The lullaby, a song of escape for Sigrid, becomes a song of entrapment when sung by him.





SHOT 51-54c: REALITY COLLAPSES


What Happens: The children's shadow puppets reveal the family's animal forms, and the empty clothes speak, counting to an impossible seven. The floor becomes transparent, revealing ancient stone 


réttir ten feet below, which already contain the family as sheep. The second raven monolith appears inside the house, prophesying Sigrid's escape and Iceland's freedom. The house speaks its identity as Bergrisi and its purpose: to die so they can transform. Time shatters, and the Bull appears inexplicably at the threshold, where the family casually steps over his dying body.





The Deeper Meaning: This sequence is the complete collapse of physical laws. The house is revealed to have impossible depth, containing their future/past selves already sorted as sheep. The raven (Gammur) explicitly links Sigrid's transformation into a bird with Iceland's freedom, giving her the prophecy and the means to escape. Bergrisi's confession confirms the house is a dying god sacrificing itself for their metamorphosis. The Bull at the threshold, treated as furniture, shows how the sacred has been completely normalized and ignored in their desperate reality.




SHOT 55-57c: RAGNARÖK AND REVELATION


What Happens: Jörmungandr/the trawler forms an ouroboros, biting its own tail, which triggers a shockwave that causes the family's final transformation mid-air. Magnús sees his family as bipedal sheep and himself as a ram in his reflection. We see the iconic image of the 


faldbúningur on the ewe, and hear the children try to say "Mamma" with human teeth in sheep mouths. The screen goes black, and in the darkness, we realize their breathing has 


always sounded like sheep. A match flickers, showing sheep bodies casting human shadows. The house speaks its last words, dying and becoming the "klettagjá".




The Deeper Meaning: The ouroboros is the mythological trigger for Ragnarök, the end of the world, which here is the end of their human reality. The mid-air transformation is the final "Action Blindspot". The horror of the transformed state is their retained consciousness—they know they are sheep. The black screen audio reveal is the ultimate truth: they were 



hamskiptingur (shapeshifters) all along; we, the audience, were the ones who couldn't perceive it until the lights went out. The house dying to become the "rocky cleft" fulfills the lullaby's prophecy and creates Sigrid's escape route.


SHOT 58-60c: MONUMENT AND ESCAPE


What Happens: Light returns to show the house has crystallized into a 40-foot black obsidian (hrafntinna) obelisk. The sheep family is visible inside, preserved and conscious forever. Guðrún-ewe speaks the film's central line: "We die as sheep so our children can become human". Sigrid enters the vertical cleft in the monument, which contains all of Iceland's history, and emerges at the top, where the raven landvættir Gammur completes her transformation. She then flies through time, laying an egg in 1920 that will hatch the human child who votes for independence in 1944. The film ends with a view of the obelisk as a modern tourist attraction.






The Deeper Meaning: The house becoming an obsidian monument is Bergrisi's rebirth. The family is preserved as a permanent, conscious testament to the sacrifice required for freedom. Guðrún's line is the film's thesis statement. The cleft is a passage through time, and Sigrid must witness all of Iceland's history to become its true witness. Her transformation, enabled by Gammur, is not a trap but a liberation. Laying the egg completes the cycle: the sacrifice generation (sheep) enables the witness (raven) to birth the free generation (human). The final scene of the monument as a tourist attraction is the ultimate colonization: their trauma has become a commodity.





SHOT 61-63: THE CAMERA'S DEATH


What Happens: The camera becomes self-aware, realizing it is the seventh presence, the eye of Iceland itself, and its accumulating frost represents the years of colonization. Its lens cracks, showing multiple timelines at once. In its final clear moment, it focuses on the 72-year-old human Sigrid voting "JÁ" for independence in 1944. The frost reaches 100% and turns brilliant white, showing every frame of the film at once, before the final image of a newborn baby's eye opening.





The Deeper Meaning: This meta-narrative confirms the viewer's role as a complicit witness. The camera's death is the death of the old, colonized Iceland. Its final choice of what to see—the vote for independence—gives meaning to the entire sacrifice. The white-out is not an ending but a transcendence, a state where all time and all realities exist at once. The witness function is transferred from the dying mechanical eye (the camera) to a new, free, human eye (the baby), and the cycle of witnessing begins again.
