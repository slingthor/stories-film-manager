"We became sheep so our children could be human."

Part One: The Mathematics of Hunger
Chapter 1: The Abandonment
The old gods began leaving Iceland on the night the Þorláksson family killed their ram, though only the children understood what the blood spirals in the snow truly meant.
It was January 1888, in that particular darkness that belongs only to the Westfjords, where the sun forgets to rise for weeks and the world becomes a geography of shadow. Above their turf house, the aurora borealis—which had danced green and faithful over Iceland since before memory—pulled away from the Earth like something disgusted. The locals would later say the northern lights looked wrong that night, burning at a frequency that made pregnant women miscarry and caused milk to sour in the breast. But the Þorlákssons were too busy discovering they had been eating nothing for three weeks to notice the cosmos abandoning them.
Magnús Þorláksson stood at the head of his table, counting his family on trembling fingers. His hands shook at exactly three tremors per second—he'd counted, being a man who found comfort in numbers even when numbers began lying. One: Guðrún, his wife, whose wrists had lately begun sprouting fine white wool that she pulled out each morning, weeping silently. Two: Jón, their son, eight years old, burning with fever that gave him visions of both present and future simultaneously. Three: Lilja, five, who had stopped speaking in words and started speaking in frequencies only the house could hear. Four: Sigrid, the sixteen-year-old girl who wasn't precisely his daughter, maintaining exactly eleven feet of distance from everyone though their house was only twelve feet wide.
Five. There were five of them.
His finger moved to count a sixth.
"Magnús?" Guðrún's voice came from the iron pot where she stirred nothing with a wooden spoon, the gesture of cooking without the substance. "What troubles you?"
He counted again. Five family members. But his hand insisted on forming the position for six, his fingers cramping into a shape that accommodated impossibility.
Through the thick glass window—handblown, precious, one of eight panes of glass in all the Westfjords—yellow light swept across the snow. The British trawler out in the fjord had been running its electric searchlights all night, illuminating nothing, documenting emptiness. The light entered their house like a government inspection, making shadows that didn't match their sources. On the wall, six shadows stood though five people sat.
"We are six," Magnús said, his voice carrying the authority of a man who had once owned thirty sheep, twelve goats, and enough dried fish to survive two winters. Now he owned hunger and the performance of eating it.
"We are five, Pabbi," Jón said, his fever-bright eyes seeing through the walls to where their slaughtered ram was somehow still running circles in the snow, its throat opening and closing like a mouth trying to speak. "We have always been five. But Iceland counts us as six."
The boy didn't know what he meant, but his fever knew. At thirty-nine degrees, the human brain begins to perceive time as a suggestion rather than a law. Jón could see three weeks ago when they'd killed the ram—the wrong ram, the one marked behind the ear, the one the old women at the réttir had warned them never to touch. He could see its blood making five perfect spirals in the snow, but somehow those five spirals created six intersection points, which was mathematically impossible. He could also see three weeks into the future, when his mother would walk into the killing cold wearing ice for a crown, searching for seaweed that didn't exist.
But that hadn't happened yet. Wouldn't happen. Was happening now.
The house breathed around them—twelve breaths per minute, the respiration of contained anxiety. This wasn't metaphor. The walls literally expanded two inches with each inhalation, the turf and stone flexing like ribs. Lilja had discovered that the floor had warm spots exactly the temperature of living flesh, arranged like organs if the house were a body laid flat. She knew, with the certainty of children who haven't learned to doubt impossible things, that they were living inside something alive. Something that had been sleeping for three hundred years, since Christianity buried the old gods beneath churches and calling them demons.
"There's something I must tell you," Guðrún said, still stirring nothing, the spoon clicking against the empty pot in a rhythm that matched the house's breathing. "The food is gone."
"The food has been gone for three weeks," Magnús said.
"Yes," she agreed. "But we've been eating it anyway."
This was true. Every morning they sat at the table. Every morning Guðrún served nothing from empty bowls, and they ate it with careful appreciation, their jaws working through the complex textures of absence. Their stomachs had learned to digest the idea of food. Their bodies sustained themselves on the memory of nourishment.
Sigrid, in her corner—always her corner, always eleven feet from everyone—placed a protective hand on her belly. Four months pregnant, though no man had touched her. Something old had touched her. Something that existed before the idea of consent, before the separation of human from animal, when the land itself could impregnate what it chose. The thing growing inside her breathed at three different rates simultaneously, as if it couldn't decide what species it wanted to be.
"The British have taken all the fish," Magnús said, as if this explained everything. Perhaps it did. Through the window, the trawler's searchlight swept across again, and in its yellow industrial light, the family flickered. For a moment—just one frame of vision—they weren't human but five sheep standing on hind legs, wearing their own clothes, human teeth grotesque in animal mouths. Then the light passed and they were human again. Or had never stopped being human. Or had never been human at all.
"Pabbi," Lilja said, her voice harmonizing with itself at frequencies that made the roof beams creak, "why does the house have a heartbeat?"
Before he could answer—before he could think of a lie sufficient to protect a five-year-old from the truth—a raven landed on the windowsill. Not a normal raven. This one stood three feet tall, its stillness so perfect it seemed like a hole cut in reality. It held that stillness for exactly twelve seconds, the duration required for witnessing, the time needed for something to be documented rather than simply seen. In its eye, which was the color of arterial blood, the family's reflection showed them not as they were but as they would be: five sheep in human clothes, walking upright through tourists' photographs, forever transformed, forever conscious of their transformation.
The raven spoke—not in a raven's voice but in the voice of Iceland itself, feminine and ancient and exhausted:
"Seks," it said. "Það eru alltaf sex."
Six. There are always six.
Then it was gone, leaving only a wing-print in the frost, showing six feathers where ravens should have five.
Chapter 2: The Testicles of the Sacred Ram
The ram had been wrong from the beginning.
Three weeks ago, when hunger had finally worn through pride like water through stone, Magnús had taken his knife to the throat of their last ram. But this wasn't just any ram—it was the one marked behind the left ear with a pattern that looked like letters in a language older than runes. The old women at the autumn réttir, the communal sheep sorting where farmers separated their flocks after summer grazing, had pointed to that mark with arthritic fingers.
"Never that one," they'd said in unison, five crones speaking with one voice. "That one keeps the boundaries."
But boundaries between what and what? Magnús had wondered then, and wondered now as he sat in the dark storage room, hiding from his family's hunger while gnawing the last hidden piece of dried fish—three days of food for one person, nothing for five, everything for none.
The ram hadn't died normally. When the knife opened its throat, it had run—not stumbled, not staggered, but run in perfect spirals through the snow, its blood drawing a pattern that hurt to perceive directly. Five spirals creating six intersection points. Mathematics breaking under the weight of death. It had run for exactly twelve minutes before collapsing, and in those twelve minutes, it had spoken. Not bleated—spoken, in the voice of something that had been waiting three hundred years to die:
"Þú seldir okkur fyrir olíu."
You sold us for oil.
Now, three weeks later, Magnús kept the ram's testicles in salt in a leather pouch, hidden where his family wouldn't find them. They were for Sigrid, for the thing growing inside her that would need the ram's procreative power to be born correctly. He didn't know how he knew this, but his bones knew, the way birds know to fly south.
In the main room, his family had arranged themselves in a pattern he almost recognized. Guðrún stood by the hearth where no fire burned—they'd run out of peat to burn, run out of driftwood, run out of dried sheep dung, run out of everything that could make warmth except their own bodies. Jón stood between his parents, his milk teeth loose, something flat and white pushing behind them. Lilja clung to her mother's skirts, humming at exactly 528 Hz, the frequency that makes DNA reconsider its commitments.
And Sigrid stood in her corner, maintaining that impossible eleven feet of distance in a twelve-foot house, space bending around her rather than forcing proximity.
They had arranged themselves in the shape of a réttir—the five-pointed funnel formation used to sort sheep by owner.
"Why are you standing like that?" Magnús asked.
They looked at him, then at each other, then at their positions. They didn't know. Their bodies had simply found these spots, the way water finds the lowest ground.
Magnús retrieved his walking stick, though he didn't need it for walking. The tremor in his hands made it tap against the floor at three beats per second, a metronomic countdown to something nobody wanted to name. On the floor, he now noticed, were worn spots—five depressions where feet had stood so often the earth had compressed into permanent marks. How long had his family been standing in these exact positions? Years? Generations? Since the house was built?
Since before the house was built?
"We need to count," he said, though he didn't know why. The words came from somewhere deeper than thought, from the place where instinct lives. "In Danish."
"Why Danish?" Guðrún asked, though she already knew. They'd all been beaten for miscounting in Danish at school, birch switches across knuckles until the colonial numbers replaced their native mathematics. The Danish had insisted: to be counted was to be civilized. To be civilized was to be owned.
"Because that's how we're counted now," Magnús said. He pointed at each family member with his trembling hand, and with each number, frost spread visibly on the walls, as if the foreign language was literally freezing their home.
"En." One. Guðrún took her position.
"To." Two. Jón, swaying with fever.
"Tre." Three. Lilja, humming her impossible frequency.
"Fire." Four. Himself.
"Fem." Five. He approached Sigrid with the ram's testicles.
She pressed herself against the wall, where hairline cracks spelled "FÓRN"—sacrifice—in the random patterns that weren't random at all. Magnús gripped her jaw with his free hand, not violently but agriculturally, the way one checks livestock. His thumb forced between her teeth, checking molars.
"Sterkir kjálkar," he said appraisingly. "Góður stofn."
Strong jaws. Good stock.
While she couldn't retreat, while she was pressed against the wall that named her sacrifice, he forced one cold testicle between her lips. It was dense with salt and iron, with the ram's final understanding of what it had died for. She swallowed it, and as it traveled down her throat, everyone in the room heard the ram's voice again:
"Þú seldir okkur fyrir olíu."
You sold us for oil.
His hand moved to point at empty air for the sixth count.
"Seks?"
Six?
The impossible number. His finger pointed at nothing, but on the wall, a sixth shadow stood clear and dark. They all saw it. The sixth member of their family who didn't exist but had always been there. Was Iceland itself. Was the absence that must be fed. Was the debt that could never be paid. Was empire's invisible presence at their table.
Outside, the trawler's horn sounded—not a mechanical sound but something organic wearing the disguise of industry. The windows vibrated, and for a moment, the house's breathing synchronized with the horn's call. Twelve breaths per minute became eleven. The rhythm of prey that knows the predator's teeth are already at its throat.
Chapter 3: The Breathing House
Lilja had been the first to understand they were living inside something alive.
She was five, young enough that the impossible was still possible, old enough to know that some truths shouldn't be spoken aloud. For weeks, she'd been walking the floor in specific patterns, her small feet finding spots that were exactly thirty-seven degrees—body temperature—while the rest of the floor remained frozen earth.
"Hér," she would whisper, kneeling to press her palm against one warm spot. "Og hér." And here.
Seven warm spots in total, arranged like organs if the house were a body laid flat. Heart here, beneath the table. Liver by the door. Lungs under the sleeping benches. Stomach in the center where they stood each morning in their unconscious réttir formation.
The house breathed—she could feel it through her bare feet, through her hands when she touched the walls. Twelve breaths per minute during the day, slowing to eight at night, accelerating to twenty-five when her father raised his voice or his hand. When her mother wept silently in the dark, pulling wool from her wrists, the house held its breath entirely, sometimes for so long that Lilja worried it would die.
But houses couldn't die. Could they?
"Mamma," she said one morning, as Guðrún performed the ritual of making breakfast from nothing—gestures of cutting, stirring, serving absence. "Why does the house have a heartbeat?"
Guðrún's hands paused in their empty work. She looked at her youngest daughter, seeing how Lilja's feet had begun to fuse slightly in her boots, how her voice had developed harmonics no human throat should produce.
"Everything that contains us is alive, elskan," she said finally. "We just forget to notice."
This was true in ways Guðrún didn't fully understand. The house—built into the hillside like all turf houses, married to the landscape so completely that in summer sheep would graze on its roof—was not metaphorically alive. It was literally, actually, biologically alive. They were living inside the body of Bergrisi, the mountain giant who had slept for three hundred years, since Christianity had arrived and declared the old gods dead.
The giant had eaten them to protect them. Swallowed them whole, family and house and all, keeping them in his stomach where they could transform safely, away from the immediate teeth of empire. But even giants couldn't sleep forever. Even mountains eventually woke.
The children knew this in the way children know things—not through learning but through recognition. Jón, sweating through his fever dreams, could see the giant's bones beneath the floor, could see how the support beams were ribs, how the doorway was an esophageal sphincter, how they'd been living inside a digestive system disguised as architecture.
"We're food," he said one night, his fever at its peak, his eyes seeing through time. "We've always been food. But for what?"
His mother pressed a cold cloth to his forehead—though they had no water to spare for fever, though the cloth was dry, though coldness was just another performance they maintained.
"Hush," she said. "Rest."
But rest was impossible when the house itself was restless. As January deepened and the food remained gone and the trawler's lights swept their home each night like a government inspection, the house began to speak. Not in words at first, but in groans that sounded like words if you listened sideways. The walls perspired—actual moisture beading on surfaces that should have been frozen. The temperature would spike to body heat, then plummet below freezing, as if the giant was suffering from fever.
Sigrid, in her corner, felt it most intensely. The thing growing inside her—not a child, not exactly, but testimony made flesh—responded to the house's distress. When the walls perspired, she perspired. When the house held its breath, she couldn't breathe. They were synchronized, she and the architecture, both pregnant with impossible futures.
She had started making something in secret. Using her grandmother's materials—a curved sheep rib, industrial rope stolen from a British sailor's corpse that had washed ashore, a brass button from the same uniform, wool pulled from her own dress—she was constructing a body for what grew inside her. The tilberi, the milk-stealing creature from old stories that nobody believed anymore. Except the stories were instructions, weren't they? Recipes for survival disguised as folklore.
The rope fought her as she worked. It had been tarred for waterproofing, made for British boats, not Icelandic magic. When she tried to wind it around the sheep rib, it would spring back, strike her face, leave marks like slave brands. But she persisted, her voice dropping lower with each attempt—the ram's testicle she'd been forced to swallow was changing her from within, making her voice more raven than girl.
"Hlýddu mér," she commanded the rope. Obey me.
And finally, it did. The rope wound around the rib, and where they touched, black veins spread through the white bone like infection, like industrial contamination spreading through organic material. She needed blood to complete it—just a drop—but when she pricked her finger, the blood didn't drop straight down. Instead, it flowed in spirals, creating the same five-pointed pattern the ram had drawn in the snow, the same impossible six intersections.
The house shuddered. Dust fell from the ceiling, but not randomly. The dust formed letters:
ÉG ER BERGRISI.
I am Mountain-Giant.
Then:
ÉG DEY.
I die.
Then:
ÞAKKA ÞESS.
For this.
Chapter 4: The Empty Sea
The morning Magnús decided to attempt fishing—though the word "decided" suggests more agency than hunger allows—the cosmos had abandoned Iceland so completely that the aurora borealis was visible moving away, like green fire crawling up into space to burn elsewhere.
He dressed in darkness, layering sealskin over wool, wrapping his grandfather's fishing line around his torso like armor, like a noose, like an embrace of what was coming. The line was rated for two hundred pounds, more than any fish in these waters, more than a man, enough for what was really out there. Three bullets rattled in his rifle chamber—there had only ever been three, the trinity of last resorts.
When he opened the door, the cold entered like a living thing. Twenty-five degrees below zero, air so frozen it burned to breathe. His family watched from their positions—still in the réttir formation they didn't remember assuming—as he prepared to leave.
"I'll bring back food," he said, the lie as thin as their bodies had become.
"There are no fish," Jón said, his fever giving him the clarity of delirium. "The British nets are the stomach of Jörmungandr. Everything swims inside the serpent now."
"There are always fish," Magnús insisted, though the harbor had been empty for weeks, though the other fishermen had stopped trying, though the trawler's presence meant the sea belonged to empire now.
He had to drag his boat to the water—one hundred fifty meters across snow that had been blood-stained three weeks ago but was now white again, as if the ram's death spirals had sunk deeper into the earth, marking the land at levels below visibility. The boat was small, built by his grandfather, repaired by his father, held together by three generations of tar and hope and splinters from every launch.
At first, the dragging seemed possible. His muscles, fed on nothing but the idea of food for three weeks, found strength in desperation. But after twenty meters, something pulled back. Not the weight of the boat—something else. The universe itself resisting his attempt, reality trying to prevent him from reaching the water.
He planted his walking stick deep in the frozen ground as an anchor and spoke the word he'd sworn never to use:
"Aflausn."
The word meant "release" but also "solution" but also the supernatural strength that comes when humans break their human limits. The berserker word. The word that costs.
His muscles expanded, veins surfaced like rope under skin. The boat moved twenty feet in one impossible surge. But the cost was immediate—blood poured from his nose, freezing instantly on his beard. His hair whitened at the temples. Three years of life spent in three seconds.
He tried again. "Aflausn!" But this time the boat moved only ten feet. More blood, from his ears now. A tooth fell out, landing in the snow with a small red crater. The mathematics were clear: each pull gave half the distance for twice the cost. He would die before reaching water.
Still eighty meters to go.
Inside the house, something else was happening. While Magnús destroyed himself trying to provide, Sigrid had completed her creation. The rope-wrapped rib with its brass button eye had begun to move. Not like a living thing, but like a thing refusing to be dead. It breathed with three rhythms simultaneously—dying, anxious, and hummingbird-fast. It tried to stand on limbs that were part-hoof, part-hand, part-neither.
"Ég er vitnisburður," it said in three layered voices. I am testimony.
The house responded to its birth with a sound that wasn't quite scream, wasn't quite laugh, wasn't quite either—the sound of something ancient recognizing something new that was also ancient, that had always existed, that would exist long after both were gone.
Through the window, Guðrún watched her husband pull the boat, age decades in minutes, fail at the only thing men were supposed to succeed at: providing. She pulled wool from her wrists—fifty millimeters now, self-braiding into three strands of past, present, and future. The wool glowed faintly, bioluminescent, as if the light that should have been in their extinguished whale-oil lamp had migrated into her body's production.
"He won't make it," she said to no one, to everyone, to the house itself.
"Nei," agreed the house through creaking beams. No.
When Magnús finally reached the water—having spent twenty years of life to cross one hundred fifty meters—what he found broke him more than the journey. The fjord was black but clear as air. He could see straight through to the bedrock thirty feet down. No kelp forests. No fish. No movement. Nothing.
On the seafloor, trawl marks scarred the rock—parallel gouges where British nets had scraped everything living into industrial stomachs. The marks formed patterns: five spirals with six intersection points. Even emptiness followed empire's impossible mathematics.
He rowed out over this nothing, dropped his line into absence, waited for what wouldn't come. The trawler watched from two hundred feet away, its yellow searchlights tracking him like eyes, like documentation, like the gaze of something that had already won and was simply observing the final moves of a game concluded long ago.
On his seventh attempt—seven, the number beyond impossible—his line went taut.
"Loksins!" Finally!
He pulled, feeling weight, resistance, hope. But as it rose through the clear water, visible from thirty feet down, it wasn't fish. It was a mass of torn net, industrial rope, brass fixtures fused with flesh. The ghost of British fishing, still trying to catch what was already gone. Tangled in it: a single fish skeleton, species unidentifiable, picked clean by nothing because nothing remained to pick it clean.
He sat in his boat in the empty sea, understanding finally what his son's fever had been trying to tell him. There were no fish because the sea itself had been caught, netted, owned. The trawler wasn't hunting—it was digesting.
The trawler's horn sounded once, shaping a word in Old Icelandic:
"DAUÐUR."
Dead.
Chapter 5: The Wool Testament
Guðrún had been pulling wool from her wrists for three weeks, but only now, watching her husband fail at the impossible task of finding food in an empty sea, did she understand what she was making.
The wool emerged continuously—sixty millimeters, seventy, eighty—no longer painful but inevitable, like breath, like heartbeat, like the passive voice of a sentence where the subject has been erased. She was producing the commodity directly from her body, becoming the means of production, the sheep and the shepherd and the wool all at once.
"This is what they want us to become," she said to her children, who sat in their positions, no longer quite human but not yet animal. "This is what we're worth."
The wool glowed in the darkness of the house—bioluminescent, carrying the light of the lamp that had died, the whale oil that had been exhausted after two hundred years of continuous burning. She was becoming her own light source, but it was the cold light of commodity, not the warm light of home.
When Magnús returned—dragging with him a piece of rotten seal fin, black with decomposition, maggots frozen mid-writhe in the flesh—she saw him for what he had become. His hair completely white. His hands at zero frequency, so still they seemed to float disconnected from his body. He had aged thirty years in thirty minutes, spending life force like currency for the chance to provide nothing.
"I found food," he said, holding up the putrid fin.
The family didn't move from their réttir positions. Only their shadows on the walls reacted, recoiling from the rot he offered as nourishment.
But the tilberi—Sigrid's creation, made of rope and bone and industrial contamination—stretched toward it, recognizing kinship with decay.
"Fæða," it said in its three voices. Food.
That's when Magnús saw what his family had become in his absence. Guðrún with wool growing from her wrists. Jón with sheep teeth emerging behind his human ones. Lilja producing wool directly from her skin. And Sigrid, pregnant with something that breathed at three speeds, maintaining her impossible distance even as space itself gave up maintaining consistency.
His rage was immediate and logical—the rage of a patriarch whose authority extends only to the boundaries of his failure.
"Þú gerðir þetta," he accused Guðrún. You did this.
She didn't deny it. How could she? Women were responsible for transformation, for contamination, for the failure of men's worlds. This had always been the mathematics: men fail outside, women are blamed inside.
He raised his walking stick. The tremor was gone—at zero frequency, there was perfect stillness for violence.
Chapter 6: The Shadow Violence
[Shots 43-45]
The beating happened in shadows, which was worse than seeing it directly. The shadow of the cane descending. The shadow of Guðrún crumpling—not dramatically but with the resignation of someone who had expected this, who had been expecting this for generations, who came from a long line of women who expected this.
She made no sound. Icelandic women's silence was louder than accusation.
The children's shadows didn't flinch. This was normalized. This was how fathers returned from the sea—empty-handed and full of violence.
After the third blow, Magnús pointed his cane at the door.
"Þarann. Safnaðu þara. NÚNA."
Out there. Gather seaweed. NOW.
Both of them knew what this meant. At thirty degrees below zero, in horizontal snow that could strip flesh from bone, with no proper clothing—it was a death sentence. But it was framed as duty, as women's work, as the last task that could justify her existence.
Guðrún rose from where she had fallen. She pulled wool from her wrists—one hundred millimeters now—braiding it quickly for warmth that wouldn't be enough. She took the useless sealskin from the hook, frozen solid, providing no insulation but maintaining the pretense of preparation.
At the door, she turned to look at her children one last time. To memorize them. Then to Sigrid:
"Þú veist hvað þú þarft að gera."
You know what you need to do.
She walked into the storm, and for the first time in years, took a deep breath unobserved. The faldbúningur headdress on her head—the traditional white cloth curved like horns or wings—immediately collected snow, freezing into an ice crown. A monument to women's roles, crystallized and made literal.
She followed Magnús's blood trail from his boat-dragging, but in reverse. Her feet fit perfectly in his footprints—the same journey, opposite direction. Behind her, the wool from her wrists left a white trail in the red path. She was creating the sixth spiral line, the impossible addition to the ram's five-pointed death pattern.
From above—if anyone had been watching from the cosmos that had abandoned them—the pattern would have been clear: a massive réttir drawn in blood and wool across the entire landscape. Iceland itself had become a sorting pen.
The polynya was where she knew it would be—a perfect circle of open water in solid ice, twenty feet in diameter, existing impossibly at thirty below. The water was exactly thirty-seven degrees, body temperature, breathing in ripples that emerged from the center every sixty seconds like a heartbeat.
At the edges grew þari—seaweed—but wrong. Geometric, growing in perfect spirals, industrial seaweed for an industrial age. This was what she had been sent to gather, though they both knew it was really death she'd been sent to collect.
She knelt at the edge and touched the water. It responded, ripples reversing, moving toward her rather than away. The water recognized her.
"Ég er hér," she announced. I am here.
The water exploded.
Part Two: The Gods Contaminated
Chapter 7: Griðungur Rises
What emerged from the polynya should not have existed, could not have existed, but did—Griðungur, the Bull of the Western Glaciers, ancient beyond measure, divine beyond question, and destroyed beyond recognition.
His head was six feet across, proportioned for a body that could have been landscape, that perhaps had been landscape before Iceland learned to distinguish between geography and mythology. But he was contaminated. Three brass harpoons grew through his skull—not into but through, the metal fused with bone at a molecular level. Industrial rope ran through his neck tissue like veins, like a secondary circulatory system made of hemp and tar. British fishing net had merged with his corneas, so he saw the world through a manufactured grid, everything pre-sorted into squares of ownership.
He was divinity contaminated, or contamination made divine—it had become impossible to tell which.
One massive eye focused on Guðrún, and in that eye she saw intelligence that preceded language, suffering that preceded nerve endings, and recognition that preceded the idea of separate beings recognizing each other.
"Þú ert merkt," he said, his voice like glaciers grinding against bedrock.
You are marked.
He meant the V-notch in her ear, hidden under her hair all these years—cut when she was married, when she became property, the same angle and depth as the marks carved into sheep ears at the réttir. But he also meant marked by existence, by being Icelandic, by being woman, by being—all the marks that make one sortable, countable, ownable.
She pushed back her frozen headdress, revealing her own V-notch scar.
"Þú líka," she said. You too.
Because he was marked as well—Danish registration numbers burned into his divine hide, British taxonomy tattooed in industrial ink, every empire that had claimed him leaving scars that had become part of his essence.
"Við öll," he agreed, water pouring from his contaminated body, not pure but thick with industrial waste. "Merkt. Talin. Seld."
We all. Marked. Counted. Sold.
Where his water touched the ice, it turned black—permanent contamination at the molecular level. He crawled from the polynya, massive body dragging onto ice, industrial materials scraping, leaving gouges that wept oil. He crawled toward the house, toward the dying giant who was the house, toward the place where Iceland was transforming from nation to commodity.
Steam erupted from every wound. His divine body was cooling from god-temperature to mortal cold. From his eyes came tears of verdigris—copper oxidation weeping from industrial contamination, green tears that froze immediately into emerald ice, precious stones made of poison.
"Ísland deyr með mér," he whispered.
Iceland dies with me.
His death would take days, but it had begun. The last of the old gods contaminated beyond survival, dying at the threshold between land and sea, between the giant who was the house and the serpent who was the trawler, between what Iceland had been and what it was becoming.
Guðrún sat beside him in the killing cold. Two marked beings. Two properties. Waiting for different deaths but the same transformation.
She pulled the wool from her wrists—one hundred millimeters now, the maximum her body could produce—and pressed it against his harpoon wounds. Where the wool touched his divine contamination, it turned black immediately, then green, then began smoking. She was absorbing his poison into her production, taking industrial contamination into the commodity of her body.
His eyes closed in relief—the first peace in centuries.
Her wrists were no longer wounds but ports—industrial outputs where human skin should have been.
From across the water, the trawler's horn sounded, shaping a word: "DAUÐUR." Dead.
The searchlights found them, held them in yellow industrial light for exactly twelve seconds—the duration of documentation, the time needed to turn reality into record. Then darkness. The trawler had pronounced death, recorded it, withdrawn interest.
Chapter 8: The House Speaks
Back in the house that was Bergrisi, that was a giant's body disguised as architecture, that was dying to let them transform, something fundamental was shifting.
Magnús had redirected his rage from Guðrún to Sigrid. She stood in her corner, back against the wall where cracks spelled "FÓRN," maintaining her eleven feet of distance even as he approached. His zero-frequency hands made him seem to float, perfectly still in their nothingness, ideal for violence.
"Ef móðirin deyr," he said, his hand on her pregnant belly, "þú verður konan."
If the mother dies, you become the woman.
The house's heartbeat accelerated—eighty, ninety, one hundred beats per minute. The giant panicking at what was being suggested. Three support beams flexed downward like ribs bending, pink tissue becoming visible through the wood. The house was revealing its flesh nature, trying to protect her.
But Magnús had passed beyond protection, beyond shame, beyond the boundaries that keep humans human. He sang the Krummi lullaby in a baritone that turned it from children's song to possession spell:
"Krummi svaf í klettagjá, kaldri vetrar nóttu á..."
His hand moved from her ankle to calf to knee. She couldn't move—where would she go? The wall behind spelled sacrifice, the man before her spelled ownership, the house around them spelled transformation.
"Þú ert minn Krummi," he said. You are my raven.
But even as he claimed her, the house was creating her escape. The crack in the wall behind her widened, not breaking but opening, becoming a doorway to not just outside but elsewhen—multiple times visible through the gap simultaneously.
Lilja began singing, but the lullaby had evolved completely:
"Sigrid svaf í klettagjá... Sigrid flýgur úr klettagjá..."
Sigrid slept in the cliff's cleft... Sigrid flies from the cliff's cleft...
The house WAS the cliff's cleft. The song was prophecy, describing escape before it happened.
A raven materialized on the table—not entered, materialized, too large to have fit through door or window. Three feet tall, geometric perfection, holding absolute stillness for twelve seconds. In its eye, the reflection showed not this room but open sky, seven ravens circling a black obsidian obelisk that didn't exist yet, or had always existed, or would exist in all times simultaneously.
"Klettagjá opnast," it said. The cliff cleft opens.
A feather fell from its wing—not down but horizontally, moving against gravity toward Sigrid. She caught it. It was warm, exactly body temperature, pulsing with a heartbeat.
"En fyrst," the raven continued, "þú verður að deyja sem þau."
But first, you must die as them.
Then the house began to speak its last words:
"ÉG ER BERGRISI. ÉG DEY FYRIR YKKUR. TIL AÐ ÞIÐ GETIÐ BREYST."
I am Mountain-Giant. I die for you. So you can transform.
Chapter 9: The Ouroboros Complete
Through the window, an impossible sight: the trawler had begun moving in a perfect circle on the fjord. Not turning—circling, bow and stern equidistant from a central point, speed increasing impossibly. Five knots, ten, twenty, thirty.
The searchlights created a spiral pattern on the water. In the wheelhouse, something coiled was visible—scales catching light, industrial barnacles grown INTO the scales rather than onto them.
The water inside the circle began to drop, not whirlpooling but fleeing, as if the sea itself was trying to escape what was about to happen.
Magnús recognized it: "Hann étur sjálfan sig."
It eats itself.
Jörmungandr, the World Serpent who holds reality together by biting its own tail, was about to complete the circuit. Through the clear water, a massive scaled tail was visible following the trawler. The tail gained on the trawler. The serpent chasing itself, closing the circle that should never close.
The trawler's hull began to open—not damage but design. The bow split, revealing industrial teeth, turbine blades modified into fangs, diesel engines become digestive system.
Everyone in the house leaned forward—the family, the raven, even the dying giant who was the house. Everyone knew what this meant.
Contact.
The trawler's mechanical mouth bit the serpent's tail.
Green-black blood exploded from the water—not regular blood but blood that burned air, that made reality scream, that contained the DNA of everything that ever swam. The shockwave hit the house: windows shattering inward, the house convulsing in death throes, the family falling.
But as they fell, they transformed mid-air.
Magnús's hands became hooves before hitting the floor. Guðrún's face elongated into sheep snout. The children's skin sprouted wool instantaneously. They were human when they jumped, sheep when they landed, both in the space between.
Only Sigrid remained human, protected in her bubble of warm air that Bergrisi had preserved with his last breath. The raven feather glowed in her hand.
"Nú," she said as chaos erupted. "Þetta er núna."
Now. This is now.
Part Three: Monument and Memory
Chapter 10: The Crystallization
The house didn't collapse—it grew.
From the earth like a tooth, like a horn, like an accusation made of black volcanic glass. The walls crystallized at 528 Hz, the frequency that rewrites matter, transforming from turf and stone into obsidian. Bergrisi's body became hrafntinna—raven-flint—the volcanic glass that forms when divine heat meets mortal cold too quickly.
Forty feet of black obelisk rising from the landscape, the family visible inside—frozen mid-transformation but conscious, eternal, aware. Magnús as ram charging forever against the walls, creating aurora effects with each impact. Guðrún as ewe, mouth eternally forming the words: "Við deyjum sem kindur til að börn okkar geti orðið fólk." We die as sheep so our children can become human.
The children as lambs, tears frozen on wool faces, human teeth visible in sheep mouths—the grotesque made permanent.
A vertical cleft opened through the monument's center—not a crack but a doorway through time itself. Inside the cleft: all of Iceland's history visible simultaneously. Vikings arriving with their sheep. The black plague in Danish ships. British trawlers beginning their extraction. Independence declared in 1944 while Allied forces occupied every strategic point. Financial collapse in 2008. Moments that hadn't happened yet.
Sigrid entered the cleft, which was eighteen inches wide outside but infinite inside. The walls weren't obsidian here but millions of ravens, black feathers forming architecture, all watching, all witnessing. She flew though she had no wings yet, moving through time like swimming through thick air.
She emerged at the top, forty feet above ground, where Gammur waited—the ancient raven, the landvættir, the witness that predated human Iceland.
"Ég kom eins og lofað," Gammur said. I came as promised.
One touch of his wing and Sigrid transformed—not violently like her family but gently. Her arms became wings, but she kept her human form too. Both at once. Her eyes remained human but saw like raven—every spectrum, every time, every possibility.
The tilberi fell from her—its purpose complete. It looked up at its mother-no-longer-mother and spoke once:
"Vitnisburður lifir." Testimony lives.
Then dissolved into its components—rope, bone, brass—elements returning to elements.
Chapter 11: The Flight Through Time
Sigrid flew with Gammur, each wingbeat crossing decades.
Beat: 1888, the obelisk fresh, family just transformed.
Beat: 1920, where she would land on Reykjavik Cathedral.
Beat: 1944, watching herself at seventy-two, voting for independence.
Beat: 2024, tourist buses circling the monument.
Beat: Times that hadn't happened yet, couldn't happen, were happening now.
In 1920, she laid an egg on the cathedral roof. Translucent shell revealing a human infant inside, curled, breathing. The child who would vote for independence in 1944. Who would dream of flying all its life. Who would fear enclosed spaces. Who would carry the genetic memory of transformation.
"Þú verður frjáls," she told the egg. You will be free. "Ég var fórn." I was sacrifice.
In 2024, she circled above the monument that had become a tourist attraction. Through the obsidian, her family was still visible, still conscious. Tour guides explained in multiple languages that no one knew who built it or when. Carbon dating showed 1888 but also 2024. Both readings were accurate.
A child tourist pressed her hand against the glass. Inside, Lilja-lamb pressed back. Their palms aligned perfectly across species, centuries, and volcanic glass.
"Mommy," the child said, "the sheep is crying."
"Don't be silly," her mother replied, taking a selfie. "It's just a monument."
Chapter 12: The Camera's Death
But we haven't been watching this story—we've been participating in it.
The camera that has shown us everything, the eye through which we've witnessed—it IS Iceland. It has been accumulating frost since the first frame, each percentage point marking a year of colonization. Now at 98%, 99%, approaching the death of the old Iceland, the one that could be colonized, the one that needed to die for the new Iceland to be born.
The camera approaches the monument, trembling at 3Hz—the same frequency as Magnús's hands, having inherited the colonizer's disease by documenting colonization. In the black glass, it sees itself for the first time: an eye, a lens, a nation, the seventh presence that's been counted all along.
"Ég er Ísland," it says in a voice we realize has always been there, underneath everything. "Ég horfi á sjálfan mig deyja."
I am Iceland. I watch myself die.
99.5%—the year 1944, independence while occupied.
99.9%—2008, financial collapse.
99.95%—now, tourists, monuments, the transformation complete.
Through the last 0.05% of clear vision, Sigrid-raven lands on the monument. She looks directly at us—at the camera, at Iceland, at everyone witnessing.
"Þú getur valið," she says. "Deyja sem þau eða lifa sem ég."
You can choose. Die as them or live as me.
100%.
White.
But white isn't death—it's everything at once. All light combined. All time simultaneous. Through the white, we see everything: every moment of this story happening at once, have happened, will happen, happening now. The ram's death spirals. The family at their empty table. The trawler biting its tail. The monument rising. This moment now. All moments.
A baby's eye opens. June 17, 1944. Independence day. The child from Sigrid's egg, grown, voting, creating the nation that could tell this story.
In the white, barely visible: frost beginning again at the edges. 0%.
Iceland watching itself transform.
Forever.
Epilogue: The Tourist
Sarah from Connecticut stood before the black monument, reading the placard that tried to explain what couldn't be explained. Her daughter Emma, seven years old, pressed both palms against the obsidian.
"Mom," Emma said, "I can feel them breathing."
"It's just your imagination, honey."
But Emma could feel it—the family conscious inside their glass prison, the ram charging eternally against walls that would never break, the ewe speaking truth that no one could hear, the lambs crying with human eyes. She could feel their breathing: eleven breaths per minute. The rhythm of prey.
Above, a raven circled. Not a normal raven—too large, too deliberate in its flight pattern. It had been circling this monument for over a century, would circle it for centuries more. Sometimes tourists claimed it spoke to them, whispered numbers in Old Icelandic: "Fimm... sex... sjö..."
Five... six... seven...
The impossible count, continuing forever.
Sarah took a selfie with the monument in the background, already thinking about the caption she'd post. Something about ancient mysteries, about Iceland's mythology, about the inexplicable beauty of things we don't understand.
In the photo, if she looked closely later, she would see six shadows though only she and Emma stood there. The sixth shadow had no source, cast by nothing, but dark and definite against the snow.
But she wouldn't look closely. Tourists never did.
Inside the monument, Magnús-ram charged against his prison for the hundred-thousandth time, his rage powering the aurora effects that danced in the black glass. Tourists thought it was an art installation, LED lights programmed to simulate the northern lights.
They were wrong.
It was actual aurora, actual northern lights, trapped in volcanic glass by a ram who had been a man who had been a failure who had been a father who had become monument to all of those things, charging forever against the walls of transformation, never breaking free, never stopping, never dying.
Guðrún-ewe stood beside him, her mouth eternally forming the words that explained everything: "Við deyjum sem kindur til að börn okkar geti orðið fólk."
We die as sheep so our children can become human.
The mathematics of survival. The bargain of generations. The price of transformation.
Emma understood, in the way children understand things they shouldn't. She understood that the monument was alive, that the family inside was conscious, that they had chosen to become livestock so that she—a child tourist from Connecticut—could stand here free, human, taking selfies with their suffering.
"Thank you," she whispered to the glass.
Inside, Lilja-lamb heard her. Pressed her wool-covered face against the obsidian. Tried to speak through sheep mouth with human teeth. What came out was: "Mææææ-aaaa-maaaa."
Emma heard: "You're welcome."
The raven above cawed once—not a caw but a word: "Vitnisburður."
Testimony.
This was all testimony. The monument, the tourists, the story, the watching. Iceland testifying to its own transformation, forever, in black glass and borrowed time and the space between human and animal where empires are born and die.
Sarah called Emma back to the tour bus. They had other sites to see—geysers, glaciers, all the natural wonders that weren't natural, weren't wonders, were all Bergrisi's body commercialized, commodified, consumed.
As the bus pulled away, Emma watched through the back window as the monument grew smaller but never disappeared, never stopped being there, never stopped containing the conscious, transformed, eternal family.
She would dream about them for the rest of her life. Dream of flying. Dream of sheep with human teeth. Dream of counting to six when only five existed. Dream of pulling wool from her wrists and braiding it into testimony.
She would never return to Iceland, but Iceland would return to her—in moments of transformation, in the space between sleeping and waking, in the mathematics of impossible things.
The monument stood in the parking lot, surrounded by tourism infrastructure, eternal.
The family inside, conscious, watched everything.
The raven circled, counting.
Five. Six. Seven.
Forever.

Final Note: The Witness Remains
This story has no ending because transformation has no ending. Iceland continues to watch itself change, accumulating frost from 0% to 100%, dying and being reborn, human and animal, free and owned, all states simultaneously.
The Þorláksson family remains conscious inside their obsidian prison, testament to the price of transformation. They are the receipt for Iceland's purchase of modernity. The documentation of what was paid.
Sigrid still flies between times, laying eggs that hatch voters, witnesses, those who will choose between being sheep or ravens. The choice is always there, always terrible, always necessary.
The house that was Bergrisi has crystallized into monument, but monuments are also alive—breathing at the frequency of stone, dreaming at the speed of geology, dying at the pace of nations.
Somewhere, in water too clean to sustain life, British trawlers that are also ancient serpents continue to fish emptiness, catching absence, processing nothing into less than nothing.
Somewhere, wool grows from women's wrists, self-braiding into the testimony of transformation.
Somewhere, children count to six when only five exist, discovering that mathematics itself can be colonized.
This is that somewhere.
This is that story.
This is that testimony.
Vitnisburður lokið.
Testimony complete.
Yet beginning again.
Always.

End of Novel

Author's Note:
Réttir exists in the space between screenplay and novel, between witnessing and participating, between the story told and the story lived. It draws from Icelandic folklore, particularly the tilberi (milk-stealing creature), the landvættir (land spirits), and the deep tradition of transformation stories where the boundaries between human and animal dissolve.
The repetition of certain phrases—"við deyjum sem kindur," "vitnisburður," "sex"—is intentional, creating a rhythm of inevitability, of truths that must be repeated because they are too terrible to be believed once.
The camera that realizes it is Iceland watching itself die is not metaphor but mechanism—the way nations document their own transformation, participate in their own colonization, witness their own becoming.
The monument stands now, will stand, has always stood, in that parking lot in the Westfjords, containing the conscious, eternal, transformed family. Tourists photograph it daily. No one hears them screaming.
Or everyone hears, and pretends not to.
Which is worse.
Which is the point.
Which is the testimony.
Hamr.
We are all hamr.
Shape-shifters.
Pretending we're not.
