@0:09-0:12 emerge showing frozen fjord with tiny house
Add: Continuous descent motion, aurora fading effect, documentary drift
Modify: Desaturate colors, remove any modern elements visible
POST-PRODUCTION NOTES:
• Color grade: Crush blacks, pull greens toward grey
• Add film grain: 35mm stock emulation
• Speed: 100% with subtle speed ramp down in final 2 seconds
• Composite: Consider adding aurora as separate layer if generation fails
SOUND DESIGN:
• 0:00-0:03: High altitude wind (filtered white noise 100-1000Hz)
• 0:03-0:06: Wind intensity increasing as descending
• 0:06-0:09: Distant ice creaking (600Hz pops at -20dB)
• 0:09-0:12: Introduction of faint trawler horn (70Hz at -30dB)
• Constant: Aurora sub-bass "breathing" (20-30Hz pulse every 3 seconds)

Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Runtime: 15 seconds | Priority: ESSENTIAL Industrial: Horn stops |
Three Layers: M (revelation) | Motif: The impossible manifest
THIS IS THE SHOT - MUST BE PERFECT
PRIMARY GENERATION PATH: RUNWAY GEN-3 ALPHA (Single take
required)
Platform: Runway Gen-3 Alpha - FULL 15 seconds, NO CUTS
THE COMPLETE PROMPT (Generate multiple attempts):
Medium shot in blizzard at night with single whale oil lamp held at waist level providing only light source,
massive Icelandic ram emerging from complete darkness and horizontal snow at 0:03 mark, ram height at
human shoulder level unnaturally large, thick white wool in ice-covered dreadlocks, upon entering lamp light
radius snow begins melting and evaporating exactly 6 inches from ram's body creating physically impossible
clear air sphere around animal, steam rising from wool forming shapes resembling reaching hands or
tentacles, eyes reflecting lamp light but wrong with orange inner fire glow not normal animal reflection, ram
stands perfectly still from 0:03 to 0:15 despite 40mph wind that moves everything else, breath visible but at
wrong rhythm 8 breaths per minute instead of sheep normal 20, ancient presence that stops time itself, no
sound from ram, documentary style, locked camera with no movement except snow and steam, hold entire 15
seconds on this impossible image, no modern elements, no cuts, no camera movement
ALTERNATIVE: VEO3 MAXIMUM DETAIL (If 15 seconds impossible)
Part 1 (0:00-0:08):
Night blizzard with lamp light only, massive ram emerges at 0:03, snow melting 6 inches from body creating
clear sphere, steam rising forming tentacle shapes, orange fire in eyes, perfectly still despite wind
Part 2 (0:08-0:15):
Continuing exact same shot, ram remains perfectly still, clear air sphere maintained, steam patterns shifting,
orange eyes unblinking, wind continues but ram untouched, hold until 0:15
PLATE + CGI APPROACH (Fallback):
1. 2. 3. 4. 6. Generate plate: Blizzard at night with lamp light
Generate ram separately on green screen
Composite with impossible physics added in post
Add clear air sphere effect
5. Add steam tentacles
Color eyes orange in post
CRITICAL MEASUREMENTS:
• Ram enters frame: Exactly 0:03
• Clear air sphere: 6-inch radius
• Breathing rate: 8/minute (wrong for sheep)
• Wind speed: 40mph (affects everything except ram)
• Hold duration: Full 15 seconds NO CUTS
SOUND DESIGN:
• 0:00-0:03: Blizzard wind at full intensity
• 0:03-0:06: Wind begins dropping
• 0:07: Trawler horn stops mid-call (cuts off)
• 0:08-0:15: Gradual silence except wind
• No sound from ram at all - presence is silent
GENIUS NOTES: The moment reality admits impossibility CRITICAL WARNINGS: MUST
HOLD FULL 15 SECONDS - this is the film's pivotal image

CRITICAL PRODUCTION NOTES
PLATFORM DECISION TREE:
IF shot ≤ 8 seconds AND needs maximum detail:
→ Use VEO3
ELIF shot 9-16 seconds AND needs continuous take:
→ Use RUNWAY GEN-3
ELIF shot needs precise compositing:
→ Use RUNWAY GEN-3 or GEN-4
ELIF shot is rapid cuts:
→ Use multiple VEO3 shorts
ELSE:
→ Default to RUNWAY GEN-3
THE FOUR SHOTS THAT DEFINE THE FILM:
1. 2. 3. 4. Shot 37b: Ram emergence - THE supernatural moment
Shot 50: Family as sheep - THE revelation
Shot 51: Headdress - THE iconic image
Shot 57: Voice - THE impossible
These four shots must be perfect. Generate as many attempts as needed.
SOUND DESIGN CRITICAL PATH:
• Trawler horn progression: 70Hz → 85Hz
• Breathing synchronization: Individual → Unified
• Industrial intrusions: 21 minimum
• Mathematical breakdowns: 5 progressive
• The 4-second silence: Exactly at Shot 38c
THREE-LAYER REALITY MAINTAINED:
Every prompt includes elements supporting:
• Physical: Starvation, poisoning, hypothermia
• Psychological: Madness, trauma, perception
• Metaphysical: Transformation, supernatural
Never collapse to single interpretation.
FINAL NOTES FOR VERSION 9.0
This is the complete, executable production bible. Every prompt can be copied directly without
any cross-referencing. Every shot has multiple generation paths. Every detail from Version 7's
artistic vision is preserved while adding Version 8's production pipeline.
The film exists in the space between what we see and what we understand. The prompts are
technical, but the result must be poetry. The industrial world continues, indifferent. The family
becomes something else, or doesn't. We count five but find six.
The horror isn't the sheep. The horror is not knowing if there are sheep. The horror is that
both answers are simultaneously true.
Generate with precision. Composite with intention. Edit with disturbance. Sound with intrusion.
In the end, even the gods have abandoned us to the sheep.
END OF PRODUCTION BIBLE v9.0
The complete vision. The complete method. The complete paradox.
