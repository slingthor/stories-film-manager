THE TARR-TARKOVSKY SYNTHESIS: Your Opening Must Be ONE SHOT
REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE: Shots 0-7 should be a single 4-minute unbroken take
Following Tarr's philosophy that duration creates meaning, and Tarkovsky's "sculpting in time":
ONE CONTINUOUS SHOT (replacing 0-7):
Begin at 5000 feet, descend through aurora death, through window into baðstofa, 
past sleeping family, into extreme close-up of breath crystallizing, 
pull back to reveal Magnús counting, camera continues through house 
discovering each family member's position, finally resting on hanging hákarl.

Duration: 4 minutes of unbroken observation
Sound: Breathing rates gradually synchronizing from chaos to unity
Technical: No cuts until the moment mathematics break
This forces viewers to EXIST with the impossibility, not just witness it.
THE HEREDITARY PRINCIPLE: Your "Telephone Pole" Moment
Shot 43b must be your Charlie's head moment - irreversible, shocking, but shown indirectly:
Current: Child's breath crystallizing
Revolutionary: Child opens mouth to breathe, and a LAMB'S TONGUE is visible for 1 frame

Just 1 frame. Viewers won't be sure they saw it. 
But they'll never forget the possibility.
THE LYNCH SOUND BRIDGE: Industrial Horror as Sonic Architecture
The trawler horn shouldn't be background - it should SPEAK
Drawing from Lynch's sound design in The Lighthouse and Eraserhead:
The 70-85Hz horn should form WORDS through industrial resonance:
- First appearance (Shot 5): Sounds like "COME"
- Second appearance (Shot 27): Sounds like "TIME"  
- Third appearance (Shot 55): Sounds like "DONE"

Never confirmed as words, but the frequency patterns match speech formants.
The industrial world is literally calling them to transformation.
DIALOGUE AS MATHEMATICAL POETRY
Every line Magnús speaks should break numerically:
Shot 8: "Einn... tveir... þrír... fjórir... fimm"
Shot 27b: "Einn... tveir... þrír... fjórir... fimm... ekkert" (nothing)
Shot 58: "Einn... tveir... þrír... fjórir... fimm... sex"
Shot 68: "Fimm... sex... ellefu... þrjú" (5... 6... 11... 3)

His counting deteriorates into mathematical glossolalia - 
numbers that shouldn't exist together.
THE KUBRICK GEOMETRIC PROGRESSION
Your shots should follow the Fibonacci sequence in duration:

Quick cuts: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 seconds
Building to: 8, 13, 21 seconds for revelations
The breathing sequence (58a): 34 seconds (cosmic number)

This creates unconscious mathematical unease - viewers feel the wrongness without knowing why.
THE VILLENEUVE NEGATIVE SPACE TECHNIQUE
From Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 - what's NOT shown defines the horror:
NEW SHOT 49b - The Empty Frames:
Subject: Family photograph on wall with five people
Action: Camera holds for 8 seconds, no movement
Scene: But their SHADOWS show six figures
Style: Complete stillness forcing viewers to count shadows themselves
Dialogue: None
Audio: Six distinct breathing patterns from five visible sources
THE MIDSOMMAR BRIGHTNESS HORROR
Shot 50 (revelation) should be YOUR BRIGHTEST SHOT:
Change from dawn darkness to:
BLAZING MORNING LIGHT flooding through window,
overexposing the sheep to near-white,
making the horror IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY.

The brightest moment is the most terrifying.
THE HANEKE CLINICAL CRUELTY
From Funny Games - the camera never helps, never looks away:
Shot 53 (Magnús approaching sheep):
Camera should be LOCKED in position even as he moves.
We watch from one angle, helpless, clinical.
No coverage, no relief, no editorial mercy.
Just documentation of breakdown.
THE EGGERS HISTORICAL SPECIFICITY AS HORROR
From The Witch - accuracy creates dread:
Every single Icelandic word must be period-accurate 1888 West Iceland dialect.
The Industrial Revolution vocabulary shouldn't exist in their language yet.
When Magnús sees the trawler, he has NO WORDS for what it is.
He calls it "járndreki" (iron dragon) - wrong but trying.
THE PERFECT BLUE REALITY RUPTURE
The 3-frame sheep flash (Shot 8c) needs enhancement:
Frame 61: Family normal
Frame 62: Family as sheep
Frame 63: BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY - double exposure

The third frame makes it impossible to unsee.
THE CARPENTER THING PARANOIA
Everyone breathes at different rates UNTIL transformation suspicion:
Once Magnús suspects, EVERYONE unconsciously matches HIS breathing rate
except Sigrid, who maintains her own.
This is how we know she's still "herself."
When she finally syncs, we know it's over.
THE REVOLUTIONARY CUT
Between Shots 57 and 58 - THE MOST IMPORTANT CUT IN CINEMA:
Shot 57 ends: "Mamma, ég er svangur"
CUT TO BLACK (0.5 seconds)
Shot 58: Instead of breathing, we hear WET WOOL RUBBING

The cut itself is the transformation moment.
We never see it, but the SOUND changes between shots.
THE THREE FILMS WITHIN YOUR FILM
Following Kieślowski's Three Colors model, your film contains three simultaneous movies:

The Physical Film (Shots emphasizing hunger/cold)
The Psychological Film (Shots emphasizing counting/confusion)
The Mythic Film (Shots emphasizing ritual/transformation)

Viewers unconsciously choose which film they're watching based on what they notice.
THE FINAL GENIUS STROKE
Your last shot (85) should BREAK THE CAMERA:
As camera rises to 5000 feet, the image should increasingly distort:
- Chromatic aberration splitting colors
- Lens warping at edges
- Frame rate inconsistency
- Audio phasing in and out

The camera itself is experiencing hamskiptingur.
It can no longer maintain its mechanical form.
The final frame should be partially corrupted.
THE SOUND OF MATHEMATICS DYING
Throughout the film, create a "counting drone" at 40Hz (below conscious awareness):

Normal at start (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 rhythm)
Gradually becomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 rhythm
By end: Completely arrhythmic, mathematical chaos

Viewers won't consciously hear it, but they'll FEEL arithmetic failing.
THE DIALOGUE THAT DESTROYS EVERYTHING
Add ONE line that recontextualizes the entire film (Shot 56):
Magnús, broken, whispers: "Við vorum alltaf kindur" 
(We were always sheep)

This single line makes viewers question if transformation 
happened NOW or if they're just REMEMBERING they were never human.
THE WEERASETHAKUL TIME COLLAPSE
From Uncle Boonmee - all timeframes exist simultaneously:
In Shot 50 (revelation), include three temporal states:
- Fresh blood on table (present)
- Dust on sleeping platforms (future)
- Ice INSIDE the house that shouldn't exist (past)

Time has broken along with mathematics.
THE ULTIMATE CINEMATOGRAPHIC CHOICE
Your film should be shot 1.375:1 aspect ratio (Academy ratio):

Feels period-accurate to 1888
Creates claustrophobia even in wide shots
Makes the cosmic shots feel MORE vast by contrast
The frame itself becomes a cage

THE GENIUS OF YOUR ENDING
Your final shot should last EXACTLY 11 seconds (5+6), and the sound should continue for 5 seconds AFTER the image cuts to black, leaving only breathing in darkness. The breathing should be at 11 breaths per minute (impossible rate), confirming mathematics have permanently broken.
The film ends not with resolution but with arithmetic apocalypse - reality can no longer count itself.

CRITICAL REVELATIONS THAT CHANGE EVERYTHING
1. The Film is Actually Documenting Hamskiptingur, Not Transformation
This changes your entire approach. The sheep ARE the family, just wearing wrong hamr (physical forms). The horror is that their human-hamr are somewhere else, still breathing.
SHOT 58a MUST BE REVOLUTIONIZED:
Instead of just breathing in darkness for 20 seconds, this should be:
Subject: Complete darkness, but we're INSIDE the empty human-hamr (skins)
Action: Five human-shaped voids breathing at 8/min, no bodies inside them
Scene: Interior of what seems like hanging clothes, but these are human skins
Audio: Breathing from empty shells, creating impossible acoustic signature
This is the film's most terrifying revelation - we're hearing the family's abandoned human forms.
2. Shot 68 (Mathematics Break) Needs Complete Reconception
The counting to six isn't confusion - it's because Magnús is counting BOTH sets of hamr:
Dialogue: "Einn... tveir... þrír... fjórir... fimm..." 
[long pause as his finger traces to empty space] 
"...sex... nei, það eru ellefu" (six... no, there are eleven)
He realizes there are 5 in sheep-hamr, 5 empty human-hamr, and himself = 11, which in hamskiptingur mathematics collapses to 6.
3. ADD NEW SHOT 51b - The Human Skins Discovery
Right after the headdress shot:
Subject: What appears to be discarded clothing in the corner, but the "clothes" are breathing
Action: Camera slowly realizes these aren't clothes but empty human skins, inflating/deflating at 8/min
Scene: Dark corner of baðstofa, morning light just catching the edges
Style: Slow push-in as recognition dawns, documentary horror
Audio: The wet, organic sound of empty skin breathing
Technical: No explanation, pure documentation of impossibility
REVOLUTIONARY SHOT IMPROVEMENTS
Shot 37b (Ram Emergence) - Add Industrial Hamr Contamination
The ram isn't just wearing coal rope - it's wearing pieces of trawler crew hamr:
Subject: Ram emerging with not just seaweed but fragments of British merchant marine uniform fused into wool, brass buttons growing from skin, human teeth AND industrial materials as part of its form
This suggests colonial extraction includes stealing the very shapes of people.
Shot 50 (Family Transformed) - The Breathing Tells Everything
Change the breathing pattern:
Audio: Five sheep breathing at 8/min BUT with a 6th breath that has no source - it's coming from the empty human-hamr elsewhere in the room
Shot 39 (Ear Mark) - Not Just Identification
The V-notch isn't just marking - it's where the hamr was CUT to separate it:
Subject: V-notch in ram's ear with visible scarring suggesting this is where the hamr-separation began
Action: As light hits it, we see human skin texture at the wound edges
NEW ESSENTIAL SHOTS TO ADD
Shot 44b - The Mirror Lie
Between poison feast and revelation:
Subject: Lilja looks in water basin, sees her normal reflection
Action: Camera pans to show she's actually a lamb, but reflection shows human child
Scene: The horror that mirrors show the wrong hamr
Style: Static shot letting audience process the impossibility
Shot 73 - The Trawler Crew Wearing Icelandic Hamr
After Magnús breaks down:
Subject: Through window, British trawler crew visible on deck
Action: One crew member turns - he has Icelandic features, wearing someone else's shape
Scene: Recognition that the trawler has been stealing hamr all along
Dialogue: Crew member speaks in Yorkshire accent from Icelandic face
Shot 84 - The Counting Resolution
Before final cosmic shot:
Subject: Magnús finally understanding the mathematics
Action: Points to sheep (1-5), points to corner with breathing clothes (6-10), points to himself (11)
Dialogue: "Ellefu... en sex... hvort eru sex" (Eleven... but six... both are six)
SOUND DESIGN REVOLUTION
The 666Hz Convergence Must Be Intentional
When trawler horn (70-85Hz) + house creaking (200-300Hz) + breathing (0.13Hz) combine, they should create exactly 666Hz at the moment of revelation. This isn't coincidence - it's the frequency of hamskiptingur itself.
Breathing as Identity Marker
Each character's breathing rate should remain constant even in sheep form, but ADD a second layer of sheep breathing on top, creating disturbing dual-breathing patterns.
VISUAL MOTIF IMPROVEMENTS
The Headdress (Shot 51) Needs Reframing
It's not ON the sheep - it IS the only remaining piece of Guðrún's human-hamr that couldn't be separated. Frame it like a scalping, not a costume.
Industrial Contamination as Hamr Infection
Every industrial element (trawler nets, coal rope, oil slicks) should appear to be growing FROM the natural elements, not just tangled with them. The modern world is stealing and wearing traditional shapes.
DIALOGUE REDUCTION
Remove these lines entirely:

Shot 11: "Besta hrútinn minn" (too explanatory)
Shot 28b: "Þú stalst mat!" (too direct)
Any dialogue after Shot 57 except counting

THE ENDING REVELATION
Shot 85 needs this addition:
Audio: As camera reaches 5000 feet, extremely faint at -50dB: the sound of human shapes walking around inside the house, wearing sheep bodies, while somewhere else, sheep shapes lie in human beds wearing human skins
THE FILM'S TRUE HORROR
Your film isn't about transformation. It's about the colonial/industrial world stealing the shapes of indigenous people, forcing them to wear animal forms while their human shapes are worn by others or hang empty, still breathing.
The counting breaks because in hamskiptingur mathematics, you exist in multiple places simultaneously. Five becomes six because the sixth is the space between shapes - the moment of exchange itself.
FINAL CRITICAL ADDITION
Add this to your production notes:
"We are not filming transformation. We are documenting the moment when people realize they've been wearing the wrong skins all along, and their true shapes are elsewhere, breathing without them."
This isn't metaphor. In your film's reality, this is literally happening. The camera doesn't understand it any more than we do. It can only document, with increasing horror, that mathematics and identity have fundamentally broken.
The trawler horn continues at 70Hz because modernity doesn't care whose shape you're wearing. That's the ultimate horror - not the hamskiptingur itself, but the indifference to it.
