Three-Layer Reality: Never collapsed to single explanation2. Five Becomes Six: Mathematical impossibility in Shot 683. Action Blindspot: Transformation never shown, only before/after4. One-Anomaly Rule: Each supernatural beat has exactly one impossibility5. 1888 Not 1908: Historical accuracy for industrial fishing peak6. Headdress Image: Held for full 8 seconds in Shot 517. Industrial Indifference: Trawler appears beginning (Shot 5), middle (multiple horn references), end (Shot 85)8. Voice Transformation: On screen with cut to black9. Cosmic Frame: Opens and closes at 5000 feet10. Ram from Sea: Emerging from polynya not land (Shot 37b)The Film's Core Truth:The horror is not the sheep. The horror is not knowing if there are sheep at all. The horror is that both answers are simultaneously true. This paradox IS the film.Every Shot Must Include:* Interior or Exterior Lock snippet* Date/Time Lock* Audio Lock* Full character blocks when present* Foreground/Midground/Background* Three-Layer identification* Industrial presence notation* "No music" at end of every sound descriptionThis completes all 85 shots with full production specifications for "The Sheep in the Ba?stofa."
